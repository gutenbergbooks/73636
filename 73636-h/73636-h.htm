<small>THE KING OF THE NARUGAS.</small></h2>

<p>“Well, young man, I think we can
tell you where Miller has gone and that
is about all the good it’ll do us or you
either!”</p>

<p>“If I know where he is I can get
him!”</p>

<p>“That’s what you Yankees call a
bluff, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show my cards if you call my
hand!” was the dry response.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I see that you have never played
poker, chief. If you did you’d understand
the meaning of the word bluff.</p>

<p>“I’m simply telling you if you think
I’m bluffing all you’ve got to do is to
give me a chance to show whether I
mean what I say or not; and to make it
perfectly plain I’ll say again that if you
know where Miller is I shall be able to go
and get him.”</p>

<p>Trim was in police headquarters at
Kimberley, South Africa.</p>

<p>He was talking with the chief of police
and the subject of their conversation
was a plan that Trim had proposed for
the capture of a dangerous criminal who
was wanted, not only by the police of
Kimberley, but of Cape Town also.</p>

<p>Trim had had two experiences with
this criminal, whose name was Jemmy
Miller.</p>

<p>In the first instance Miller, who was a
steeple climber by trade, had attempted
to murder Trim, and failing, had escaped
capture at the time by the exercise of his
wonderful skill in climbing.</p>

<p>An account of this matter has been
published in “Trim in Cape Town,” No.
9 <span class="smcap">New Nick Carter Weekly</span>.</p>

<p>Detective business had brought Trim
to Kimberley, where he had exposed a
gang of robbers who had obtained possession
of a vast quantity of diamonds.</p>

<p>During the investigation of this matter
he had again come across Miller and it
was certain that the steeple climber was
connected with the diamond thieves.</p>

<p>He had given them warning of Trim’s
approach and while the young detective
and the old sailor, who was his companion
in Africa, were busy with other members
of the gang, Miller had made good
his escape.</p>

<p>After all the other members of the
gang had been captured Trim had made
up his mind that for his own satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
he would undertake to put Miller behind
the bars.</p>

<p>When he returned from an all-night
chase after the last of the robbers, he
told the chief of police that if his local
detectives would make an effort to find
in which direction Miller had gone he,
Trim, would undertake to give chase and
bring the fellow to justice.</p>

<p>The chief had willingly consented to
this plan and on the following morning
Trim called at headquarters to learn what
progress had been made.</p>

<p>After a long sleep the boy felt as fresh
and active as ever and eager to begin
work. It therefore made him impatient
when the chief sneered at his confidence
in his ability to catch Miller.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of the great American
game of poker,” remarked the chief,
“but I have never played it, so I won’t
try to talk about bluffing again.</p>

<p>“What I mean to say is that while we
all admire your courage and shrewdness
and while we are willing to admit that
you’ve done the colony a great service I
must say that you are now undertaking
something that is beyond your powers.</p>

<p>“It would be a more sensible thing for
you to drop it entirely. Miller won’t
trouble us again and besides that——”</p>

<p>The chief paused and Trim said:</p>

<p>“Speak up, chief, you needn’t be afraid
of hurting my feelings.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you Americans think
that you’re about as smart a nation as
there is in the world, and that you can
do everything.</p>

<p>“I’d have you understand that we are
no spring chickens down here in Africa,
and what you’re trying to do we have
tried and given up.</p>

<p>“It would be just as well for your
reputation and for us, if you would drop
the matter.</p>

<p>“Amuse yourself in Kimberley as long
as you like for you will always be welcome,
and admit that there’s one detective
problem that you can’t solve.”</p>

<p>“You make me dead crazy to get to
work,” retorted Trim. “What is this
problem that you fellows haven’t been
able to solve? I thought that Miller was
comparatively a new criminal to you.”</p>

<p>“So he is. We never heard of him
until he skipped up from Cape Town to
escape you.</p>

<p>“The problem existed long before we
ever heard of Miller, and I’ll tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would, for you have
stirred up my curiosity.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, it’s not a long story.
It begins back about ten years ago.</p>

<p>“This town was more of a frontier settlement
then than it is now, and it was
not such an easy thing to preserve order.
I had been on the police force for some
time and had gained the rank of sergeant.</p>

<p>“There was always plenty to do in
those days, for the diamond diggings attracted
desperate characters from all
parts of the world.”</p>

<p>“Just like any mining camp in that respect,”
remarked Trim.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, although I’ve never
had experience in any other.</p>

<p>“Well, we were doing our best to
shape things into some kind of order and
we thought we were getting along pretty
well, when there was a series of the most
outrageous and terrifying crimes.</p>

<p>“It seemed as if a perfect fiend had
broken loose and taken up his residence
in Kimberley. You’ve heard about Jack
the Ripper, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” answered Trim.</p>

<p>“This fellow was not a Jack the Ripper,
but I speak of that famous criminal
simply because our fiend and Jack were
alike in two respects.</p>

<p>“Each was bloodthirsty, and each
was wonderfully successful in escaping
capture.</p>

<p>“The victims of our fiend were all
men, however, so that there was no other
resemblance to the savage who gave London
such a scare a few years ago.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it is necessary for me
to go into the details of the various
crimes that startled, bewildered, and exasperated
us.</p>

<p>“I will only say that murder was the
object in every case and that the crime
was committed by strangulation.”</p>

<p>“Did he choke his victims with his fingers?”
asked Trim.</p>

<p>The chief shook his head.</p>

<p>“I think not,” he said. “There were
marks upon the victim’s throat that
proved strangulation beyond any shadow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
of doubt, but they were not finger
marks.”</p>

<p>“What were they, then?”</p>

<p>“We have always supposed that they
were made by a bowstring.”</p>

<p>“That suggests,” said Trim, “that the
murderer was a Chinese or a Malay, or
some such fellow?”</p>

<p>“No. We thought that for a time,
too, and every Chinese in the colony was
under suspicion. We learned better.
The murderer was a white man——”</p>

<p>“Then you finally got on to him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. We learned a good deal
about him and we know now where he
is.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t try to capture him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is interesting. Excuse my
interruptions and go on.”</p>

<p>The chief smiled.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d see before long,” he
remarked, “that we have a very pretty
problem here in Kimberley and that it
takes more than a young American’s
pluck and shrewdness to solve it.</p>

<p>“It would take too long to tell how,
after seven or eight murders had been
committed within the space of as many
months and all without doubt by the
same man, how we finally got on the
right track.</p>

<p>“So let it pass for the present that we
did get started and that we found the
murderer to be a man named Mulvey.</p>

<p>“Mulvey was an ex-convict. He had
been a soldier and I think also a sailor,
for it is certain that he had knocked about
the world much more than most men.</p>

<p>“His object in committing murder in
such a wholesale manner may have been
partly robbery, but I’m inclined to think
that it was more a mania for killing.</p>

<p>“The important thing is, however, that
Mulvey discovered that he was suspected
just about as soon as we began to think
that he was our man.</p>

<p>“Then he disappeared. Of course we
took that fact as positive proof that he
was the man we were after.</p>

<p>“We telegraphed to all parts of the
southern continent where the telegraph
reached, to have the police look out for
him.</p>

<p>“The authorities of neighboring countries
like the Orange Free State and the
Dutch Republic gladly united with us in
an effort to run him down.</p>

<p>“If he had gone from Kimberley to
any civilized town we certainly should
have known it, for we had his picture
and description complete. He could not
have escaped us.</p>

<p>“After some weeks of vain looking for
him in the white settlements we were
forced to conclude that Mulvey had either
become a solitary wanderer or hermit, or
that he had joined a tribe of savages.</p>

<p>“Meantime we had been looking up
his past record as far as possible, and
from that we came to the conclusion that
he had joined the savages rather than become
a solitary wanderer.”</p>

<p>“What was his record?” asked Trim.</p>

<p>“As I said, he had been a soldier and a
convict but previously to his turning up
in Kimberley we learned that he had
been living in Central Africa, and that
he was on mighty good terms to say the
least, with the Narugas.</p>

<p>“The Narugas are a small tribe who
live in Gordonia in the western part of
Bechuanaland.</p>

<p>“Gordonia is several hundred miles
from here and to reach it one has to travel
across an unsettled country and cross the
lands of several uncivilized tribes.</p>

<p>“Most of the natives there are peaceful
enough now, for they have had their fill
of resisting John Bull’s soldiers.</p>

<p>“I speak of that because if you wish to
travel to Gordonia there is no very great
difficulty in your way.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that any of the tribes
would resist your progress, although it is
possible always that some of them should
be up to mischief.</p>

<p>“I’m getting ahead of my story and
will return to the time when we came to
the conclusion that Mulvey had joined a
native tribe.</p>

<p>“We learned, as I say, that he had
been on good terms with the Narugas.</p>

<p>“His crimes had been so horrible and
many that it was determined to make
every effort to capture him.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, a squad of police was
organized for the purpose of going to the
Narugas to learn whether Mulvey was
there and to bring him back.</p>

<p>“We went. It was a long, tiresome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
journey and we came back empty-handed.”</p>

<p>“Did the Narugas show fight?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. They were too shrewd
for that.</p>

<p>“They knew that fight meant war and
that war meant the overrunning of their
territory by the British army. They
avoided that but they pursued a policy of
retreat and hiding in such a way that we
could never come up to more than two or
three of them at a time.</p>

<p>“They live in an extremely mountainous
district where it is very difficult to
make one’s way through the forest.</p>

<p>“Naturally they know every foot of
the ground and can get about much
easier than white men. We had our
knapsacks and other baggage to lug
along. They had none.</p>

<p>“We were so satisfied that Mulvey was
with them somewhere that we made prisoners
of two or three and kept them with
us trying to induce them to tell the truth.</p>

<p>“We didn’t succeed, but we became
more and more satisfied that Mulvey was
one of them.</p>

<p>“They referred to their chief as Malva
and it is our belief that that is their way
of pronouncing Mulvey.</p>

<p>“After we had scoured the mountains
as well as we could we came back to
Kimberley.</p>

<p>“The authorities here were not altogether
satisfied with what we had done
and sent out another expedition. I was
with the second expedition, also.</p>

<p>“We went so far as to capture two or
three of the tribe’s men and start back to
Kimberley with them, intending to use
them as hostages.</p>

<p>“We let it be understood among the
Narugas that if they wanted their men
back again they must surrender Mulvey.</p>

<p>“This, you must understand, was only
after another thorough campaign among
the hills in which, as before, we would
learn of the existence of a village only to
go there and find it deserted.</p>

<p>“We could never come across more
than two or three natives at one time.</p>

<p>“We had started back to Kimberley,
taking our prisoners with us. After being
on the march about three days a messenger
overtook us.</p>

<p>“He gave us a note written on the
bark of a tree in very bad English, but
if you had seen it your skill as a detective
would have told you that the bad
English was merely a disguise.</p>

<p>“The man who wrote it understood
English as well as we do. It was an attempt
on his part to pretend that he was
a savage chief who had learned a little of
our language from missionaries.</p>

<p>“We had not then, and I have not
now, the slightest doubt that Mulvey
wrote that note.”</p>

<p>“What did it say?” asked Trim.</p>

<p>“It was to the effect that if we didn’t
release his men he would see to it that
the bowstring should be applied in Kimberley
and that more than one man would
come to the town for the purpose of committing
murder.</p>

<p>“It was quite a long note. It contained
a promise that if the tribe were let
alone Mulvey would give us no more
trouble.</p>

<p>“If we persisted in bothering the tribe
the savages would send every year several
of its members to Kimberley for the purpose
of committing secret murder.</p>

<p>“Well, we thought it over and continued
on to Kimberley with our prisoners,
telling the messenger that we would
send him word after we had seen the
great chiefs of the city.</p>

<p>“The great chiefs thought it over. It
was certain beyond a doubt that Mulvey
had joined the Narugas. That was one
thing.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t much doubt that he
would put his scheme of revenge into
operation if we persisted in pursuing
them.</p>

<p>“The Narugas live, as I have told you,
at a distance of several hundred miles.
We had their promise that the crimes
with which we had been troubled should
cease entirely.</p>

<p>“That promise might not amount to
anything, but as we had already spent a
great deal of money and energy in trying
to get hold of Mulvey, it was decided
that it would be worth while to test that
promise.</p>

<p>“If the crimes ceased altogether and
Mulvey never returned to civilization we
would be so much the gainer.</p>

<p>“He was as harmless to us out there as
if we had hanged him in the prison yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“On the other hand if there should be
so much as one more crime of that character
that could be traced to Mulvey or
his tribe we would then be justified in
asking the military authorities to take
action and simply wipe the Narugas off
the earth.</p>

<p>“On the whole, as I have said, it
seemed better to give this white chief a
chance to keep his promise, so we sent
our captives back to Gordonia with a
message to their chief telling him our decision.</p>

<p>“The promise has been kept.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you had any further
trouble with Mulvey?” asked Trim.</p>

<p>“Not a particle; but there is one thing
in the case that we don’t like.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Mulvey’s little kingdom has become
the refuge of some of the worst criminals
in this part of the country.</p>

<p>“When a murderer, for example, finds
that the officers are after him so sharply
that he can’t escape them by any other
means, he lights out for Gordonia.</p>

<p>“When he gets there I suppose that he
is received by King Mulvey and made a
member of the tribe. At any rate we
never hear of him again.</p>

<p>“Up to date we have not felt much like
disturbing the Narugas on this account
because it would mean a war of extermination,
and as it was with Mulvey so it
is with every other criminal who goes
there.</p>

<p>“Once he gets among the Narugas we
have no further trouble with him, so perhaps
the city is just as well off as if we
caught and hanged every murderer that
we tried to.</p>

<p>“At the same time, if it could be done
without calling out the military forces,
we should all be very glad to have Mulvey
and his white companions brought
back.”</p>

<p>“How many whites are there with
him?” asked Trim.</p>

<p>“There are four desperate men whom
we know of that we suppose are now
among the Narugas with him. Miller
will make the fifth.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Then he has started for Gordonia,
has he?”</p>

<p>“Without the shadow of a doubt! We
have traced his steps to the extent that
we are satisfied that he has gone there.</p>

<p>“He had twenty-four hours’ start. If
we should send a hundred horsemen out
after him and scatter them over a big extent
of territory we might perhaps overtake
him, but it strikes me that the most
sensible thing is to let him go.</p>

<p>“Once he gets started toward Gordonia,
as our experience shows, we shall have
no further trouble with him.”</p>

<p>“But you say that you’d like to have
Mulvey and Miller and the other whites
brought to justice?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it could be done without a
war it would make things look better.
Yes, we should like it.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Trim, rising, “I’m going
to take an excursion to the Narugas
and see what I can do.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br><br>
<small>HALTED BY SAVAGES.</small></h2>

<p>The chief leaned back in his chair and
drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“That will mean,” he said, “one smart
American the less in the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think,” retorted Trim.
“If you fellows could go out there and
come back alive I don’t see why I
shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>The chief shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Our expedition,” he said, “was made
up of older men than you are, and when
a fellow gets old enough to have a beard
on his face he understands that caution is
quite as important to success as courage.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re thinking,” responded
Trim, “that I shall go out there
and hit the first head I see?”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t strike me as if you
would be able to get along without a
row. You don’t seem to be a fellow who
will stand very much nonsense, and I
just give you warning that these savages
in Central Africa often make trouble for
travelers and unless they are handled
carefully the result is likely to be bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know me,” remarked
Trim. “I shall come back alive unless
I’m carried off by a fever or an accident.”</p>

<p>“Of course I hope you’ll succeed in
coming back alive.</p>

<p>“There isn’t the remotest chance that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
you’ll be able to get hold of Mulvey or
any of his white men, although it is possible
that you may run across Miller if
you start at once.</p>

<p>“It’ll take him some time to go to
Gordonia, and he may lose his way. If
you should come across him I advise you
to come back with him and let the others
go.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see about that, chief, if it happens
that I find Miller on the way.</p>

<p>“Meantime, if you have got any
pointers that you can give about the roads
and so on, I will be glad to have them.”</p>

<p>The chief rather unwillingly told Trim
about the various travelers’ routes across
Bechuanaland, and gave him, also, some
little information about the many tribes
whose territory he would have to pass.</p>

<p>At the end of the conversation Trim
returned to his hotel where his old friend,
Dobbin, was awaiting him, and together
they made preparations for a journey
westward.</p>

<p>Although Dobbin had learned to have
confidence in Trim’s judgment, he was
nevertheless a little in doubt about this
excursion to the Narugas.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of it, lad?” he
asked. “Why don’t ee take things easy
a bit?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any fun in sitting still, old
fellow,” was Trim’s response.</p>

<p>“No, that ee don’t.”</p>

<p>“Would you rather stay quietly here
in Kimberley until I come back?”</p>

<p>“Bless yer brave heart, no, lad. I could
not sleep of nights if I thought ee was
trampin’ across the wilderness without
me by to look out for ee.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you can stand the journey I
certainly hope you’ll come along.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I can stan’ it as well
as I could if there was a good ship’s deck
under me feet, an’ perhaps I’ll not be
able to walk as fast as you like, anyway——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we shall do much walking!”
interrupted Trim. “We shall
travel by donkey.”</p>

<p>“Donkeys, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It seems that is the animal that
is used in this part of the world for long
journeys.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if the donkeys can stan’ it
I fancy an old sailor like me can.”</p>

<p>As it was necessary that they should
have a party of attendants as well as a
large supply of provisions and a quantity
of articles like glass beads to give to the
savages, they were kept very busy for a
full day in making ready.</p>

<p>Trim did not regard the time as lost,
for he had no hope whatever of overtaking
Miller, the man he was especially interested
in, before arriving at the country
of the Narugas.</p>

<p>Besides that his ambition was thoroughly
aroused now. He would not be
content to return with Miller alone.</p>

<p>His American pride had been touched
by the chief’s sneers and he wanted to
return to Kimberley either with all the
white criminals who had escaped justice
or at least with information that they
were no longer alive.</p>

<p>It was for the reason that he hoped to
bring back a number of prisoners that he
engaged a rather large party of attendants.</p>

<p>Two of these were white men whom he
had picked out as fellows likely to be
daring and faithful and the others were
half-civilized natives who had made many
similar journeys as the carriers and servants
of ordinary travelers.</p>

<p>The party started early in the morning.
The single railway that runs through
Kimberley was of no use to them, as its
general direction is north and south.</p>

<p>For a long distance they were to proceed
almost due west, and therefore from
the very start they traveled upon donkeys.</p>

<p>Little needs be said of the first three
days of their march. During that time
they traveled upon a well-beaten road and
passed several settlements of white men.</p>

<p>As long as they were in the boundaries
of Cape Colony there was no probability
that they would be interfered with by
natives, or that they would meet with
other than ordinary adventures.</p>

<p>This proved to be the case and it was
not until they were well over the borders
of Bechuanaland that their journey became
especially interesting.</p>

<p>It was all interesting to Trim, however,
because he was seeing a new part of the
world and getting acquainted with
methods of life that were unfamiliar to
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>At the end of the third day they
camped near a small stream.</p>

<p>They had hardly begun to make their
arrangements for the night when three
black men appeared from the edge of the
forest not far away and slowly approached
them.</p>

<p>“Those be different lookin’ niggers
than any we have seen yet, lad,” remarked
Dobbin, eying the newcomers
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ll find them much the
same as the rest,” responded Trim.
“They’re probably curious about us and
take the same sort of interest in us that
children do in a circus parade.”</p>

<p>This, in fact, had been the kind of attention
they had received thus far in the
journey.</p>

<p>Wherever they went the black men
whom they passed stared at them open-mouthed,
and when they went into camp
or paused for dinner they were often
watched at a little distance by groups of
natives.</p>

<p>Up to this time no natives had spoken
to them.</p>

<p>These three came straight up to the
camp and stopped at a little distance from
Trim and Dobbin, who were seated carelessly
upon a box.</p>

<p>One of the black men made a motion
with his hand. Trim did not know what
it meant, but he promptly imitated the
motion and stood up.</p>

<p>“I presume that means how do you
do,” he said to Dobbin.</p>

<p>The black then said a few words in his
own language.</p>

<p>Among Trim’s party there were several
who could act as interpreters, and Trim
beckoned one of them to his side.</p>

<p>“What has the dark-complexioned gentleman
got to say?” asked Trim.</p>

<p>“He demands to know,” was the reply,
“who you are and what your purpose
is in being here.”</p>

<p>“Ask him who he is and by what right
he makes such a demand?” said Trim.</p>

<p>The interpreter spoke to the black
man, who replied promptly in words that
the interpreter translated as follows:</p>

<p>“We are elders of the tribe of Pombas.
We live at peace with all men and trouble
none who don’t come bringing war.</p>

<p>“We own this land, although the great
white queen has asked for it. We have
no trouble with the great white queen,
but we still have the right to live here.”</p>

<p>“The great white queen,” added the
interpreter, “is her Majesty, the Queen
of England.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” responded Trim, “and
they seem to have a good deal of respect
for her. I reckon we shan’t have any
trouble with them.</p>

<p>“Tell them that we are the sons of the
western stars and that we are passing
through their country simply on our way
to where the stars have their thrones.</p>

<p>“Let them understand that we don’t
intend to give them any trouble, and that
we shall return by this same way at a
later day.”</p>

<p>The interpreter delivered this speech
which the black men received with
solemn interest. Then they conversed
together for a moment.</p>

<p>At length, facing again toward Trim,
they made another speech through their
spokesman.</p>

<p>The interpreter grinned as he turned
to his employer to translate it.</p>

<p>“They say,” he said, “‘that it is the
custom of well-meaning travelers to pay
for the privilege of camping in this territory.’”</p>

<p>“We’ll settle that quick enough,
then,” responded Trim. “Tell them
that they shall be liberally rewarded.”</p>

<p>With this he opened the box upon
which he and Dobbin had been sitting,
and took from it a handful of the cheapest
kind of beads and other such ornaments.</p>

<p>The eyes of the savages glistened as
they saw the trinkets.</p>

<p>Trim gave them each a few of these articles
and then held his hands over their
heads, making gestures slowly and
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” he said to the interpreter,
“that the western stars look kindly
at them.”</p>

<p>The interpreter did as directed, whereupon
the savages dropped upon their
knees, touched their foreheads to the
earth, mumbling all the time, and then
departed.</p>

<p>“See here, Dobbin,” exclaimed Trim.
“You’ve got to keep a straight face at
such times as this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Lord bless ee, lad,” returned Dobbin;
“how could a man keep straight
when ye was goin’ all through that monkey
business?”</p>

<p>“It meant everything to them,” responded
Trim, “and if you don’t stop
grinning when such fellows are around
you’ll break the snap.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be as sober as a deacon after
this,” Dobbin declared.</p>

<p>They saw no more savages that night
and met none during the next day’s
journey.</p>

<p>On the day following, however, as it
came on toward evening they observed
that they were followed by half a dozen
blacks who seemed to be doubtful
whether they should come up to the party
or not.</p>

<p>Trim did not like their actions and was
prepared in his own mind for trouble.</p>

<p>He consulted a map of the territory
that he had taken with him and found
that he was now in the land of the
Massais.</p>

<p>“In times past,” he said to himself,
“the Massais have given a good deal of
trouble to the great white queen and we
are now so far from any white settlement
that we may have to look sharp.”</p>

<p>The blacks followed along after them
for several miles.</p>

<p>At last the travelers made ready to
camp at the shore of a small lake.</p>

<p>As before Trim and Dobbin sat upon a
box while their employees did the work.</p>

<p>Trim kept his eyes upon the blacks,
who now approached rapidly.</p>

<p>When they came up their leader spoke
in loud tones and in what appeared to be
a threatening manner.</p>

<p>The interpreter whom Trim summoned
was evidently uneasy.</p>

<p>“It’s the same question,” he said.
“They demand to know by what right
you are traveling here and why you camp
in this spot?”</p>

<p>“Give them the same answer back,”
responded Trim.</p>

<p>“Tell them I want to know what right
they have to ask questions, anyhow.”</p>

<p>So the interpreter spoke, and after the
black had answered he said:</p>

<p>“They say that they are warriors belonging
to the tribe of Massais.”</p>

<p>“Is that all they say?”</p>

<p>“That is all.”</p>

<p>Trim reflected quickly.</p>

<p>“The very fact that they announce
themselves as warriors is a threat. I shall
have to meet them on their own ground.”</p>

<p>He arose and spoke to the blacks as if
they could understand him. His voice
was loud and stern.</p>

<p>“Go back to your tribe!” he said. “I
will not waste words with warriors. If
your tribe has anything to say to me it
will send its elders.”</p>

<p>The blacks listened in evident surprise
at the boy’s tones and manner.</p>

<p>When the interpreter had translated
his remarks they looked still more surprised.</p>

<p>They conversed with each other for a
moment and then slowly departed.</p>

<p>“That was a good bluff!” remarked
Trim, with a long breath.</p>

<p>“I don’t half understand it, lad,” said
Dobbin, seriously.</p>

<p>“The point is,” explained Trim, “that
these tribes are governed by men whom
they call elders, and as I understand
them, the warriors have no right to act
without the advice of the elders.</p>

<p>“If the elders should make up their
minds that we ought to be slaughtered
our case would be hopeless, but it’s my
opinion that when they threaten the only
way to meet them is by keeping up a
bold front and giving them threats in return.</p>

<p>“As long as the stock of glass beads
holds out I am willing to buy peace from
all the tribes of Africa, but that must be
done through the elders and not through
the warriors.”</p>

<p>“I suppose ye are right, lad. In fact I
have no doubt of it, but if it was to come
to a fight with those chaps——”</p>

<p>“You and I could do up that little
party single-handed!” interrupted Trim;
“but if it came to two or three thousand
of them where would we be then?”</p>

<p>Dobbin threw up his hands in despair.</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t come back!” he
said.</p>

<p>About an hour later supper had been
eaten and the travelers were preparing to
bunk for the night, when they saw a
larger party of blacks approaching.</p>

<p>Among them were the warriors who
had addressed them. The blacks came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
close up to the camp and this conversation
followed, the speeches being translated
of course, by an interpreter.</p>

<p>“You have sent for the elders of the
Massais,” began the chief black man,
“and we are here.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” Trim responded.
“We didn’t send for the elders, but that
is no matter. We are glad to see you.
You are welcome.”</p>

<p>“Who are you and why are you here?”
asked the black.</p>

<p>“We are travelers, as you see. We are
at peace with the Massais and simply intend
to cross their territory.”</p>

<p>“We think you don’t mean peace.”</p>

<p>“But we do mean peace! We have no
wish to trouble the Massais and we are
willing to make gifts to the elders to show
our good will.”</p>

<p>As in the previous case Trim and Dobbin
opened the box and took out a quantity
of trinkets.</p>

<p>They approached the savages with
these.</p>

<p>The eyes of the black men glistened
with interest as they saw the trinkets,
but they did not put out their hands to
receive them. Trim accordingly laid the
trinkets at their feet.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, “we come as
friends.”</p>

<p>The speaker for the black men looked
doubtful.</p>

<p>“We will take your presents,” he said,
after a moment, “and let you go in peace,
but you must go back, not forward!”</p>

<p>Trim answered sternly to this.</p>

<p>“We shall go forward, not back! The
Massais must not stand in our way!”</p>

<p>Trim’s determined manner evidently
made an impression upon the blacks, for
the elders consulted together for several
minutes.</p>

<p>The warriors in the party meantime
strolled impudently within the camp itself
and having untied one of the donkeys,
were starting off with it.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” commanded Trim.
“Bring that animal back or there’ll be
trouble right here!”</p>

<p>The elders called to the warriors, who
unwillingly brought the donkey back
and then withdrew to a little distance.</p>

<p>“We’ll think it over,” said the spokesman,
finally, “but the white man must
not go from this place until we have had
more talk.”</p>

<p>With this they gathered up their
trinkets and marched away.</p>

<p>Trim paced up and down for several
minutes in anxious thought after they had
gone.</p>

<p>“Be ee goin’ to turn back, lad?” asked
Dobbin.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not!” answered Trim; “but
I’ll admit that the situation is serious.</p>

<p>“We cannot afford to make enemies of
this big tribe, and we cannot afford to
show them that we are afraid of them,
either.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought to have offered them
another handful of playthings. We’ll try
that on in the morning.</p>

<p>“Somehow or other, Dobbin, I’m
going to make these fellows give us a
free pass to the furthest side of their territory.</p>

<p>“If those mischief-making warriors can
be kept quiet for another day I think we
shall be all right.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain: we shall have
to stay in camp here until we get the
permission of the elders to go forward.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br><br>
<small>THE SPIT OF PEACE.</small></h2>

<p>The camp was not troubled by the savages
during the night.</p>

<p>Trim waked up several times to take a
look around and on each occasion the
pickets told him that they had seen
watchmen of the savages approach near
enough to the camp to see that it was
quiet, and then retire again.</p>

<p>It was clear, therefore, that the Massais
were simply watching Trim to see that
he did not go without their permission.</p>

<p>When morning came he found that several
hundred blacks were gathered at a
spot a little way from the camp, and directly
upon the route that he would have
followed had he proceeded with his journey
to the westward.</p>

<p>The savages were making no noise,
and but for the bows and spears they had
with them would have seemed like an
ordinary crowd of curiosity seekers.</p>

<p>Trim rightly judged that this was a
part at least of the native army.</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking their purpose
in gathering at that particular place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>It was their intention to prevent the
white man from going on.</p>

<p>The half-civilized blacks employed by
Trim were nervous at this spectacle, but
the lad ordered them to go about preparations
for breakfast just as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>Breakfast was eaten in the camp, not
one of the white men there appearing to
pay the least attention to the Massai warriors.</p>

<p>After breakfast Trim stretched himself
upon the ground and waited for what
might happen next.</p>

<p>Presently three blacks approached from
the direction of the army; Trim recognized
them as the elders with whom he
had talked the evening before.</p>

<p>He arose promptly, stepped forward to
meet the elders, bowing and making
broad gestures with his arms to indicate
his respect; then he held out his hand
for the chief elder to shake.</p>

<p>The elder took the hand solemnly,
grasped it, muttered a few words, then
let it go.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Trim to the interpreter,
“that the white traveler is anxious
to go on, and that he is waiting because
he wishes to do so without giving the
Massais unnecessary trouble.”</p>

<p>The interpreter spoke as directed, and
the elder after listening gravely replied:</p>

<p>“He says,” translated the interpreter,
“that he admires the white traveler and
does not wish him to come to harm; he
thinks, therefore, that the white traveler
had better face to the rising sun and so
escape.</p>

<p>“He assures you that if you do so no
one of his warriors will be permitted to
touch you.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Trim, sternly, “that
the white traveler proposes to go toward
the setting sun, and that there must be
no delay about it.”</p>

<p>“Those warriors,” suggested the interpreter,
timidly, “could overcome the
whole of us easily.”</p>

<p>“Tell him what I said!” exclaimed
Trim, sharply.</p>

<p>The interpreter therefore turned to
the elder and while he was speaking
Trim and Dobbin reopened the box of
trinkets.</p>

<p>They took out double handfuls of them
and brought them to the elders, who on
this occasion received the articles from
the white man’s hands.</p>

<p>They were evidently greatly pleased,
although they tried to look serious and
unmoved.</p>

<p>Many of the trinkets were intended for
wearing as if they were jewelry.</p>

<p>The elders could not resist the temptation
of stringing the beads around their
necks, putting the cheap bracelets on
their arms, etc., to see how they looked.</p>

<p>This done, they strutted up and down
for several minutes, speaking to each
other and apparently discussing the wonderful
value of the articles.</p>

<p>The chief elder went to one of the
others, took a bracelet from his arm and
put it on his own; the other jabbered at
him apparently in indignation, whereupon
the chief elder took the smallest
string of beads from his own neck and
gave it to the one from whom he had
taken the bracelet.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” remarked Trim to Dobbin,
“that the scheme is working pretty
well; these fellows are like children after
all.</p>

<p>“The leader is bound to have the best
of it, and the others are more likely to
quarrel with him than with us.”</p>

<p>Presently the elder put on a very
solemn expression, marched up to Trim
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>Trim took and shook it gravely.</p>

<p>“He says he likes you better than before,”
said the interpreter.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” responded Trim, “that
the white traveler considers that he is
the greatest man in this country, and
that if he will wait a minute the white
traveler will present him with the most
important offering of respect that he possesses.”</p>

<p>The interpreter translated and the
elder’s eyes fairly burned with excited
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Ee’ve got him all right when he
shakes hands with ee, haven’t ee, lad?”
asked Dobbin.</p>

<p>“Shaking hands is not enough for
these people,” Trim replied, “if they
were whites a handshake might be a sign
of faithful friendship; as it is, I’ve got to
wait for a stronger expression from
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Saying this he was rummaging in the
box of trinkets.</p>

<p>Down at the bottom was an opera hat
that Trim had put in with the idea that
it might come handy for just such an
emergency.</p>

<p>It may be explained that an opera hat
is an article very commonly worn by
swells in civilized life.</p>

<p>It is a hat that has springs in the
crown by means of which it can be
crushed as flat and very similar in appearance
to a platter.</p>

<p>Work the springs in the opposite way,
and the hat becomes a regulation stove-pipe.</p>

<p>It has not the shiny appearance of the
tall silk hat, but in other respects it is
exactly like it.</p>

<p>The hat lay in its flat condition at the
bottom of the box.</p>

<p>When Trim took it out and approached
the elder the latter looked surprised and
disappointed; he had evidently hoped
for something bright, and he would have
probably been tickled with a baby’s rattle.</p>

<p>Trim stood before the elder and handed
his own hat to Dobbin; then he worked
the springs of the opera hat, almost
bursting with laughter as he saw the
elder’s eyes bulge with surprise at the
change that occurred in the article.</p>

<p>Very gravely Trim then placed the hat
on his own head; after leaving it there a
moment he took it off and set it on the
head of the savage.</p>

<p>The black man swelled with pride, he
puffed out his cheeks and strutted up and
down before his companions with the
most comical air of importance.</p>

<p>Dobbin was so nearly overcome with a
desire to laugh that he coughed violently,
and had to hide in Trim’s tent to keep
from spoiling the effect of the proceeding.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the elder put his hands up
to the hat and took it from his head with
great care; he seemed to be afraid that it
would drop and break.</p>

<p>He felt of the crown, looked inside, and
was apparently very puzzled.</p>

<p>Trim saw what was in the great man’s
mind, so he stepped up to the elder, held
out his hand for the hat, took it, and with
a smart blow pushed the top of the crown
down to the rim, thus restoring the hat
to the shape of a platter.</p>

<p>The elder’s jaw dropped as if he feared
that the beauty and usefulness of the
thing had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Trim quickly worked the springs again
in the opposite direction, and again the
hat assumed its stove-pipe appearance.</p>

<p>Then the lad handed the hat back to
the elder. The latter timidly pressed his
hand against the top of the crown. He
was a little afraid of it at first, but presently
he had crushed it, and the next
moment he had worked the springs outward.</p>

<p>Then for at least a dozen times he
amused himself in opening and shutting
the hat, while his two companions looked
on with admiring and envious curiosity.
At length the chief elder put the hat on
his head and held out his hand to Trim,
at the same time jabbering rapidly.</p>

<p>It was a long speech. The interpreter
translated it all to Trim, but the long and
short of it was that while the elder was
very grateful and had the biggest sort of
respect for the young white traveler, he
was still of the opinion that it would be
better if the white traveler should face
about and go to the east.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Trim, “he hasn’t
withdrawn his army yet, but I’ve made
some progress; he isn’t threatening any
longer, but on the other hand he seems
to be advising me.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he fears that his army
won’t obey him?”</p>

<p>After a moment of reflection, Trim said
to the interpreter:</p>

<p>“Tell him that it is very important for
the white traveler to go on to the west; it
would be impossible for him to turn back,
even if by going on he should go to certain
death.</p>

<p>“Ask him if he knows any reason why
the white traveler should be afraid to
go on.”</p>

<p>After this had been translated to the
elder there was another long speech.</p>

<p>“He says,” translated the interpreter,
“that he thinks the white traveler is not
like other travelers.”</p>

<p>“He believes that you are going to see
a man, and he is very certain that that
man will make trouble for you.”</p>

<p>“What does he care about that?” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
Trim, wonderingly. “What
business is it of his whether I get into
trouble beyond his country or not?”</p>

<p>“From what he says,” responded the
interpreter, “I think he means that he
has some kind of an arrangement with the
Narugas for stopping an expedition like
this.”</p>

<p>“I began to think it was something of
that kind,” said Trim.</p>

<p>“Tell him that I fear no trouble, and
that I shall go on whether he gives permission
or not.”</p>

<p>When this had been translated the elder
looked solemnly at Trim for a moment,
and then held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Third time never fails,” remarked
Dobbin, who was watching the scene
from the shelter of the tent.</p>

<p>Trim was not yet satisfied, however.
He knew that three handshakes from this
tribe was not enough to be a promise of
friendship.</p>

<p>“Tell him I’d like to look at his army,”
he said.</p>

<p>This was translated and the elder
promptly turned toward the big crowd of
blacks and beckoned to Trim to go with
him.</p>

<p>Trim promptly followed, and Dobbin
fearing that his young friend was about
to be led into a trap got up from the tent
and ran after.</p>

<p>The interpreter went along also, and
Trim made a number of complimentary
remarks about the appearance of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>“I believe,” he thought, as he looked
the crowd over, “that half a dozen pistol
shots would scatter this gang, but what
good would that do if one of their poisoned
arrows should happen to scratch my
skin?</p>

<p>“We must get out of this peacefully,
and I think we shall manage to do it.”</p>

<p>The elder told about the courage of his
men, and how they had fought all surrounding
tribes successfully, and how
they had yielded to the great white queen
because of her magnificent presents to
them, and not because of her armies.</p>

<p>Trim took it all in as soberly as possible,
and told the chief elder that this
meeting was one of the greatest pleasures
of his life.</p>

<p>At length the chief elder addressed the
army, saying but a few words and waving
his hand commandingly. At that the
soldiers, most of whom had been squatted
on the ground, rose and began slowly to
go away.</p>

<p>They had no more than started when
the chief elder once more extended his
hand to Trim, and, having grasped it,
spat upon the lad.</p>

<p>“By all that’s decent!” roared Dobbin,
in a great rage, “I won’t stan’ that, not
even if he is the king of all Africa!”</p>

<p>The old sailor started forward with his
fists doubled up to revenge the insult.
He would have mauled the chief elder to
a pulp before the army could have had
time to shoot an arrow if it had not been
for Trim.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Dobbin!” he cried, sternly.
“Keep your shirt on and go back to
camp. This is the best thing that could
have happened.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” answered Dobbin, stopping
short not so much because of Trim’s
stern command as because of the perfect
amazement with which he saw Trim give
the chief elder’s hand a hearty shake and
then spit upon him.</p>

<p>After that the chief elder shook Trim’s
hand again, made three or four gestures
and walked away.</p>

<p>“Now we can go on,” said Trim, turning
to the astonished Dobbin. “And we
shan’t have any trouble from the Massais.”</p>

<p>“Whoever heard of a white man letting
a nigger spit on him?” exclaimed the
sailor.</p>

<p>“Well, I have,” returned Trim. “I
heard of it before I started on this trip,
and it was what I was waiting for.</p>

<p>“When the Massai shakes hands and
spits on you it means that he is forever at
peace with you, and nothing could induce
him to do you an injury; so I say we’re
all right now, and we’ll break camp and
lose no more time here.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br><br>
<small>AN EXECUTION.</small></h2>

<p>It proved that Trim was entirely right.</p>

<p>They passed several Massai villages
during that forenoon’s march, but in
none of them were they interrupted in the
least.</p>

<p>Trim told the men to push their donkeys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
on as fast as possible, for now that
he had time to think of it it struck him
that the adventure with these savages had
a good deal of meaning for him.</p>

<p>The elder did not regard him as an ordinary
traveler. The elder was quite certain
that he was going to find a man who
would make trouble.</p>

<p>“Now what does that mean?” thought
Trim. “These tribes see white travelers
once in a while. How can they learn to
tell a trader or some scientific explorer
from a man who is going out on detective
business?</p>

<p>“There’s only one explanation to it,
and that is that Miller, while on his way
to the Narugas, warned the Massais that
he might be pursued.</p>

<p>“If these savages have some kind of
an arrangement with the Narugas, what
is more likely than that they would try to
scare a pursuer back?</p>

<p>“We have got out of the trouble with
them peacefully, but some of those warriors
who interfered with us first were
evidently disappointed at the orders to let
us go on.</p>

<p>“Now it would not be at all surprising
if one or two of those same fellows should
go ahead and warn the Narugas that we
are coming.</p>

<p>“If the Narugas are really as desperate
as the Kimberley police think, we may
have loads of trouble with them before
we get through.”</p>

<p>This prophecy was well justified by
later results, but the Narugas were yet a
long way off, and Trim found plenty to
interest him before he arrived at the borders
of their territory.</p>

<p>On the second day after the adventure
with the Massais they came to the Orange
River.</p>

<p>This river is one of the greatest in the
world. It flows westward into the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p>Trim’s men told him that a great deal
of time and trouble would be saved by
floating down the river on rafts for somewhat
more than a hundred miles.</p>

<p>It would take him a little out of his
course to do this, and yet it would bring
him to the borders of the Narugas’ territory.</p>

<p>It would save time because if he proceeded
overland he would have to cross
several mountain ranges where there were
no roads, and where the climbing would
be very difficult even for the well trained
donkeys.</p>

<p>This seemed to Trim to be a sensible
suggestion, especially as traveling by raft
is one of the common ways of journeying
in Africa.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he went into camp there
and during the rest of the day and a part
of the night he and his men worked at
making two rafts.</p>

<p>It was not a very difficult matter, for
the rafts consisted principally of trees cut
down, stripped of their branches, and
bound together with tough vines that
grew along the banks of the river in
abundance.</p>

<p>Less than a whole day was lost in this
operation, and when the rafts were done
it was found that they would easily hold
the entire party, donkeys included.</p>

<p>The current of the river at that spot
was not swift, and when the journey was
resumed the men had no difficulty at all
in guiding the rafts by means of poles so
that they kept in mid stream and avoided
rocks and shallow places.</p>

<p>Later in the day they came to rapids,
and there they had more trouble.</p>

<p>It was nothing of a very serious nature,
but it required their men to keep on the
jump all the time in order to prevent the
rafts from bumping against rocks or being
thrown against the banks of the river
which there was very crooked.</p>

<p>The most serious difficulty came when
one of the donkeys was pitched overboard
as the second raft whirled rapidly around
a big rock in the very middle of the
river.</p>

<p>Trim was on the first raft. He looked
back when he heard the cries of his men
and saw the donkey struggling helplessly
in the current.</p>

<p>The men were for letting the little
beast go, but Trim thought differently.</p>

<p>“Each donkey,” he said, “is of as
much use as a man, and that one must be
saved.”</p>

<p>He accordingly steered his raft to shore
and ordered the second one to halt just
below the rapids where the water ran
smoothly. Then he waded into the middle
of the stream and waited for the donkey
to come down to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The frightened beast was struggling
with the current trying desperately to
make for the shore, but being carried
along by the force of the water in spite
of all he could do.</p>

<p>“If the little rascal could get his feet
on the ground,” thought Trim, “he’d
get out.”</p>

<p>The donkey didn’t succeed in getting
a foothold, and before long he came tumbling
along to where Trim stood waist
deep waiting for him.</p>

<p>Trim caught the donkey around the
neck and tried to drag him toward his
own raft near the shore.</p>

<p>The donkey evidently did not understand
Trim’s plan, and more than that
he had a mind of his own, such as it
was.</p>

<p>He brayed and bellowed while he
kicked and struggled to get loose from
Trim’s clutch. The lad held on like
death.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, you idiot!” he shouted.
“If you want to get drowned, this is the
surest way of doing it. Let me alone
and I’ll get you out of this.”</p>

<p>It need not be said that the donkey did
not understand these remarks.</p>

<p>Trim spoke just as any one will in
dealing with animals, hardly conscious
of the fact that animals have no language.</p>

<p>He laughed even as he did so at the
thought of the peculiar spectacle he presented
struggling in the middle of a river
with a frightened donkey.</p>

<p>It had its funny side, but it was a hard
struggle just the same, for Mr. Donkey
was bound that he would kick himself
free and make for the opposite shore,
while Trim was equally determined that
he should yield and go to the raft.</p>

<p>In the course of the struggle the donkey’s
head went under the surface.
When it came up his bray gurgled and he
threw out two or three quarts of water.</p>

<p>“Behave yourself!” roared Trim, who
the next instant was carried under.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a shillin’ on the donkey,”
shouted Dobbin, who was howling with
laughter from his position on the raft
near the shore.</p>

<p>“Even money on the man!” cried one
of the whites who was on the other raft
further down stream.</p>

<p>“If you fellows would shut up your
hollering and come out here,” shouted
Trim, “we might get the durned beast
out of it.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let a donkey duck me, not
I,” cried Dobbin.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” retorted Trim,
“I’ll save the little rascal, see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>Between the force of the current and
the struggles of the donkey Trim found
it impossible to keep his footing or to
make any progress toward the shore.</p>

<p>He was being borne gradually, though
steadily, down the stream. Meantime
the donkey did not cease his efforts to
make for the other shore, and Trim kept
his arm around the beast’s neck as desperately
as if his own life depended on success.</p>

<p>So they went stumbling and slipping
down stream until at length they were at
the bottom of the rapids and thus near
the second raft.</p>

<p>One of the men there held out a pole to
Trim which he grasped and so was pulled
alongside.</p>

<p>The water there was so deep that he
could not touch bottom, and it was useless
to try to lift the donkey out. The only
thing to do was to push the raft into shallow
water near shore.</p>

<p>This was done, and after not a little
splashing and obstinate resistance on the
part of the donkey, the beast was finally
hauled on board, where he shook himself
and uttered a long-drawn bray.</p>

<p>“That may mean joy because he got
out,” said Trim, “but it certainly doesn’t
mean gratitude to me for saving him.”</p>

<p>Seeing how the affair was coming out,
Dobbin had had the first raft pushed from
shore, and he was now abreast of the
second.</p>

<p>“When we get to England, lad,” he
cried, “I’ll have the humane society
give ee a brass medal for kindness to
animals.”</p>

<p>“I’d be proud of it,” retorted Trim, as
he leaped across to his own raft.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day they went
into camp at a place where the river was
broad and where there was level land on
each bank.</p>

<p>During the most of the journey they
had been floating between rugged mountains,
and for many a mile they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
have found it difficult to make a landing.</p>

<p>Some distance down the river Trim
saw smoke rising. One of his native employees
told him that there was a village
there, and that the people who lived in it
had been beaten in war by the Narugas.</p>

<p>“The Narugas must be near by, then,”
remarked Trim.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the black man, “they’re
not very far away; in fact, you might call
this their land.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Because the tribe that live here, the
Bangwas, are now under the power of
the Narugas.</p>

<p>“The Bangwas once upon a time were
a powerful tribe, but there are not many
of them left now, and when they made
war on the Narugas a few years ago,
they were badly beaten.</p>

<p>“It would have been possible for the
Narugas to kill them all off, but they
didn’t do so; instead they allowed the
chief to return to this village, where he
rules his tribe as if he were independent,
but in reality he is under control of the
king of the Narugas.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to get acquainted with
that chief,” thought Trim.</p>

<p>Aloud he said:</p>

<p>“Are the Bangwas peaceable toward
white men?”</p>

<p>“Enough so,” was the reply. “They
would make no resistance if we were
passing down the river, but it’s just as
well that they shouldn’t see us on land.</p>

<p>“If we stay in camp here through the
night, we can pass their village early to-morrow
morning on the rafts without attracting
their attention.”</p>

<p>Trim nodded and turned away. He
had learned enough to convince him that
he ought to make an effort to see the
Bangwas, for if they were under the control
of the Narugas it was almost certain
that some of the latter tribe would be in
the village.</p>

<p>He said nothing to his companions
about his thoughts, but after the camp
was quiet for the night he cautiously left
it alone and started along the bank of
the river toward the distant village.</p>

<p>Before going he had taken the precaution
to arrange his revolvers in his
sleeves.</p>

<p>Usually when traveling in the wilderness,
Trim did not carry his revolvers in
this fashion, as they might have been in
his way when it was necessary to do
rough work.</p>

<p>It seemed to him now that it would be
well to be prepared for trouble because it
was more than likely that information
about his approach had been carried on
ahead, either by Miller himself, or by
some of the Massais.</p>

<p>Although it was long after sundown
when Trim set out, he had no difficulty
in locating the village of the Bangwas,
for the savages had built a huge fire
which threw its light far up into the sky.</p>

<p>Trim approached it cautiously, for it
struck him that the building of a fire
meant that some kind of celebration was
in progress, and that all the natives would
be stirring.</p>

<p>He had no wish to be seen by them
until he had had a chance to observe them
and make up his mind what he ought to
do.</p>

<p>He found that the village was not built
close to the river bank, but on higher
land two or three hundred yards away.</p>

<p>This, he learned later, was because the
river overflowed its banks at certain seasons
of the year.</p>

<p>Between the village and the river there
was a broad stretch of open land from
which all trees and bushes had been
cleared away.</p>

<p>When Trim came to this he could see
the fire at the head of this open stretch,
and he had no difficulty in distinguishing
the forms of natives who were circling
slowly around it.</p>

<p>As they did so they kept up a strange
kind of singing, accompanied by a peculiar
beating upon an instrument like a
drum.</p>

<p>Trim supposed that this was some kind
of religious ceremony.</p>

<p>For fear that the light of the fire would
reveal him if he ventured into the open
space, he made his way toward the village
through the underbrush, always
keeping near enough to the edge to see
the fire.</p>

<p>He had come within a few rods of the
fire and could not have gone much
further without entering the village itself,
when the singing ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>The men who had been circling around
the fire gathered in a group at one side.</p>

<p>From one of the huts a savage, who
was evidently their king, came out and
began to speak in a loud voice.</p>

<p>A moment later three or four others
brought from another hut a man whose
hands were bound behind his back.</p>

<p>They made this man kneel before the
king. The latter then continued his
speech, which the others interrupted occasionally
with loud shouts.</p>

<p>At the end of the speech, all except
the man who was kneeling waved spears
and clubs in the air.</p>

<p>Trim was very much interested. As
yet he had no idea of the meaning of this
ceremony, but he had not long to wait
before it was horribly clear.</p>

<p>After the spears and clubs had been
waved and the men had shouted several
times, the king stepped back a few paces.</p>

<p>Trim could see that he was still engaged
in looking on and directing whatever
work was in hand.</p>

<p>One of the men in the party dropped
his spear and climbed a small tree that
grew not far from the fire.</p>

<p>Soon the tree began to shake and bend
under his weight, and still the man
climbed up. The tree bent lower and
lower until at last the man was hanging
to its topmost branches, his feet dangling
downward.</p>

<p>His weight bent the tree double, and
some of his companions reaching up,
caught him by the feet and pulled him
down.</p>

<p>He still clung to the tree, so that its
top was bent clear down to the level of
the ground.</p>

<p>Several others then laid hold of the
tree and kept it from springing back to
its upright position.</p>

<p>Meantime the man who had been
kneeling put his head forward upon the
ground and cried out in evident terror.</p>

<p>Trim, of course, could not understand
the words used by the savages, but it was
very plain that this fellow was badly
frightened.</p>

<p>While the savages were busy in bending
the tree over, the frightened man began
to crawl toward the king.</p>

<p>The latter raised his arm, evidently as
a signal, for several of the others leaped
upon the kneeling man and dragged him
to the spot where the top of the tree was
held down.</p>

<p>For a moment, then, Trim could not
see what was going on, because the savages
were gathered in such a thick group.</p>

<p>After a moment most of them near the
treetop withdrew to the edge of the fire,
leaving only three or four of their companions
and the kneeling man by the treetop.
Those who were left were evidently
still holding the tree down.</p>

<p>There was a moment of perfect silence.
Then the king raised his arm again and
uttered one word in a terrible voice.</p>

<p>Immediately the men who were holding
down the treetop sprung aside. At the
same moment Trim realized what was being
done and was so horrified and excited
that he jumped from his concealment and
began to go across the open space toward
the house.</p>

<p>He was too late. The tree sprung back
to its upright position, carrying with it
the body of the man who had been kneeling.</p>

<p>A cord had been fastened about his
neck and tied to the treetop. The result
of the operation was that his neck was
broken.</p>

<p>Trim had witnessed an execution;
whether of a criminal or simply of someone
who had displeased the king, or of
some member of a neighboring tribe, he
could not tell.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br><br>
<small>SURPRISED IN CAMP BY A STRANGE
ENEMY.</small></h2>

<p>The victim’s body had not ceased to
sway back and forth with the motion of
the tree before the savages discovered the
presence of a stranger.</p>

<p>Trim’s first feeling had been that he
would prevent that execution, but he
saw he was too late, at the same time
that he saw that he had been observed.
He therefore walked calmly forward, as
if he was familiar with the place and had
no fear of the savages.</p>

<p>His boldness served him a good turn,
for if he had made a hostile movement
the savages undoubtedly would have
fallen upon him at once and made an
end of him.</p>

<p>As it was three or four of them armed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
with spears strolled out from the circle
around the fire and confronted him.</p>

<p>Trim halted at once and remarked
quietly:</p>

<p>“I wish to speak with the king.”</p>

<p>The warriors looked at him in astonishment.
One of them turned about and
said something to the king, who motioned
with his hand toward the group at
the fire.</p>

<p>At this signal another man left the
group, came forward and addressed Trim
in broken English.</p>

<p>“What you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am a traveler,” Trim replied, “and
I came to your village because I saw the
light of the fire. I should like to buy
food and pay my respects to the mighty
king of the Bangwas.”</p>

<p>The interpreter translated this speech
to the king, who thought a moment,
made a reply, and walked into his hut.</p>

<p>“His majesty,” said the interpreter,
“wishes you to come in.”</p>

<p>The warriors stood aside and Trim advanced
to the king’s house. It was nothing
more than a shanty such as no western
miner would have put up with.</p>

<p>The king was seated on the ground.
Trim remained standing while the interpreter
came in and stood at his side.</p>

<p>For a moment the king looked Trim
over, scowling, and then spoke to the interpreter,
who translated.</p>

<p>“His majesty say you very young and
that more white men must be with you
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Trim responded.</p>

<p>The king then asked what Trim was
there for, and he answered much as he
had in the case of the other savages who
had questioned him. He concluded by
promising the king valuable presents for
food.</p>

<p>Of course Trim needed no provisions,
but this way seemed to be the best for
getting on good terms with the tribe.</p>

<p>The king thought a long time and at
length said, through the interpreter:</p>

<p>“You saw the execution?”</p>

<p>Trim admitted this.</p>

<p>“You intend to tell the English people
about it,” remarked the king.</p>

<p>Trim saw that the king was very much
disturbed and he understood the reason.</p>

<p>The English who control that part of
Africa try to make the savages live according
to civilized laws. The king believed
that if a description of this execution
should be given to the English
there would be trouble for him and his
tribe.</p>

<p>Trim was thinking fast in order to find
out what to say that should cause the
king to be less suspicious, when a warrior
hastily entered the hut, knelt before
the king and spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>The king was evidently greatly interested.</p>

<p>He glanced at Trim with more curiosity
than ever, and at length said,
through the interpreter:</p>

<p>“I know now why you are here.
You’re going to make war on the
Narugas.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to harm any black
man or any black tribe,” responded
Trim.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” retorted the king,
“you are an enemy to the Narugas.”</p>

<p>He then gave a command which was
not translated, but Trim understood it
well enough when two warriors entered
the hut, took him by the shoulders and
ran him rapidly out to the fire.</p>

<p>The boy made no resistance, but he
was on the alert for he knew that trouble
was coming.</p>

<p>He was left at the edge of the fire while
all the savages who had been standing
there withdrew to one side.</p>

<p>The two warriors who had rushed him
to the spot then took up their positions
in front of the king’s house, while one of
them took a bow that was hanging on the
wall of the hut, and selected an arrow
from a quiver that leaned beside it.</p>

<p>“Tell the king,” said Trim to the interpreter,
who appeared in the door of
the hut, “that I know what he intends to
do. Tell him that the Bangwas’ arrows
cannot hurt me!”</p>

<p>This remark was translated to the king,
who merely grunted and evidently gave a
command to the warriors, one of whom
raised the bow and aimed the arrow directly
at Trim.</p>

<p>The boy stood still, apparently not
alarmed, and watched the savage as he
took careful aim.</p>

<p>A moment later there was a twang as
the savage let go the string and an arrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
shot forward. At that instant Trim
raised his right arm suddenly.</p>

<p>There was a loud report, and the arrow,
broken in two, fell harmlessly mid-way
between him and the savage who had
shot it.</p>

<p>A cry of wonder went up from the
crowd.</p>

<p>They had not seen the weapon which
Trim had fired, but they had seen the
flash that seemed to come from his empty
hand.</p>

<p>They saw him now standing as before
at the edge of the fire with both hands at
his sides.</p>

<p>The king got up and stood at the door
of his hut looking on with as much wonder
as the rest of them.</p>

<p>“It would be just as well,” thought
Trim, “to sneak out of this while they
are paralyzed with surprise, because they
might jab one of those poisoned arrows
into me while I’m not looking.”</p>

<p>So he said aloud:</p>

<p>“The king made a mistake in trying
to kill me. I shall return now to my
people. If you let me alone I shall not
harm you, but if you try to kill me I
shall come again with my people and
death will leap from both my hands.”</p>

<p>Saying this he raised his arm again
quickly, and fired one of the concealed revolvers
in such a way that the bullet
broke the point of a spear that was held
by a warrior near the king’s house.</p>

<p>This time the savages drew back, muttering
with more astonishment.</p>

<p>Trim walked slowly toward the river
and as he went the savages were careful
to get out of his way.</p>

<p>As soon as he arrived at the edge of the
underbrush he went quickly in among
the small trees for fear that if he continued
down the open stretch arrows
might be sent after him from behind.</p>

<p>Once among the trees he turned around
and looked back at the fire. He saw the
savages still standing motionless with surprise.</p>

<p>The boy watched them for a moment
wondering what they would do and was
about to start on again when he saw all
the savages turn their heads toward the
further side of the fire.</p>

<p>Immediately after that they all knelt
and a moment later a man came striding
into view, who in spite of the darkness
Trim recognized as a white man.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought Trim. “Perhaps I
shall learn something here, after all.”</p>

<p>The white man spoke in a loud voice
so that Trim caught his words.</p>

<p>“What was that shot?” he said.</p>

<p>Trim then saw the king and the interpreter
approach the white man and
answer him.</p>

<p>Their words could not be distinguished,
and when the white man spoke
again he lowered his voice.</p>

<p>Trim could see that the white man
made a quick movement of surprise, and
turned his head in the direction of the
river.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a string of glass beads, old
chap,” said Trim to himself, “that you’re
wondering who I am and where I am.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Suppose this fellow
should be King Mulvey himself! What
a snap it would be to disable him with
just one little pistol shot and run him
back to Kimberley as a prisoner.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t do, though. Miller is
the man I’m after, and besides Mulvey
there are four others who are wanted in
Kimberley, and I shan’t feel that I’ve
kept up my reputation if I don’t succeed
in bringing them all back.</p>

<p>“No, Mulvey, if that’s your name, I
shall have to let you go for the present,
but I’ll see you later, or I’m no American.”</p>

<p>Trim watched the scene until the white
man withdrew into the darkness beyond
the fire and the savages went to their
huts.</p>

<p>The boy was sorely tempted to make
an attempt at the capture of the white
man.</p>

<p>“I could talk with him,” he thought,
“and with him in my possession there
would be more chance of my getting at
the rest of his gang unobserved.”</p>

<p>He stood up and looked around him.
It was a dark night, but just beyond the
village he could see the outlines of steep
hills. They were without doubt thickly
wooded.</p>

<p>“It would be a mighty foolish thing to
do,” he concluded, “to try for that man
in the night, and in a strange woods, and
without the slightest idea of where he is
going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“No, the best thing will be to stick to
the other course.”</p>

<p>So he turned to the river and came at
length to his own camp.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Trim was aroused
by the sounds of his men making ready
for departure.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes long enough to
give orders for all to breakfast on shore,
and to awaken him again when they were
ready to start.</p>

<p>Then he turned over and the next second
was sound asleep again.</p>

<p>Dobbin looked after the arrangements.
He had just finished his own breakfast
and was preparing to help drive the donkeys
on to the raft when his attention
was attracted by a strange sound at a distance.</p>

<p>All the others listened also.</p>

<p>“It’s an elephant,” said one of the
blacks.</p>

<p>“Never heard an elephant trumpet like
that before,” replied Dobbin, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“It’s an elephant, though,” insisted
the black, slapping one of the donkeys
and driving him hurriedly onto the raft.</p>

<p>“We’d better get aboard as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“May be no danger,” remarked another
black.</p>

<p>The first black shook his head.</p>

<p>“That elephant has must.”</p>

<p>“Must what?” asked Dobbin.</p>

<p>The blacks then explained to him that
<i>must</i> is the word for a strange madness
that sometimes attacks elephants. They
then become like maniacs and destroy
everything that comes in their way.</p>

<p>At such times elephants are the most
dangerous animals in the world.</p>

<p>One of the blacks ran to the top of a
low knoll near the river’s edge and immediately
hurried back crying:</p>

<p>“It’s a big bull and he’s coming
straight for this spot.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! Yes!” cried one of the
white employees. “You can tell by the
marks around here that this is an elephant’s
ford. They are in the habit of
coming here, and we are in their way.”</p>

<p>The men hustled the donkeys on to the
rafts and one was pushed off from shore
with most of the party aboard.</p>

<p>Dobbin ran up to Trim, who was sleeping
peacefully, and shook him.</p>

<p>“Wake up, lad!” he cried, hastily.
“They say there’s an insane elephant
making for ee.”</p>

<p>“A what?” demanded Trim, sleepily.</p>

<p>“There’s an elephant amuck, lad.
Stir your steps or he’ll stamp on ee.”</p>

<p>Even then there came the sound of
furious trumpeting just over the knoll
beyond the camp.</p>

<p>Trim had read enough about elephants
to know that when they are troubled with
this madness it is well to be out of their
way, and seeing that everything was ready
for departure he jumped up and hurried
to the raft.</p>

<p>Half a dozen blacks were on board with
poles ready to push the raft into mid
stream.</p>

<p>Just as Trim landed he discovered that
his pocket spyglass which often proved
of use to him, had slipped from his pocket
and was back on the bank.</p>

<p>“Push out!” he cried, as he leaped
again for shore. “I’ll be after you in a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless ee, lad!” cried Dobbin, in
terror. “Don’t do that. Come back!”</p>

<p>Then seeing that Trim was determined
to go back to the camp, which was but a
few yards away, Dobbin also made an
effort to get on the land. The men on
the raft held him back.</p>

<p>“I’ll be all right!” shouted Trim.</p>

<p>He dashed to the spot where he had
been lying, picked up his spyglass and
started back to the raft.</p>

<p>Just as he was stooping to pick up the
glass the elephant appeared over the brow
of the knoll. He was trumpeting madly
and swinging his trunk from side to
side.</p>

<p>Trim’s foot caught in a vine as he
neared the water’s edge and he fell full
length. The elephant saw him and he
came tearing down the slope after him.</p>

<p>“Lord save us!” cried Dobbin. “He’ll
stamp the poor lad’s life out!”</p>

<p>Trim was on his feet in an instant, and
facing the giant beast.</p>

<p>He drew his revolver, although he
knew how poor a weapon it was in fighting
such an animal.</p>

<p>A pistol bullet could not do more than
pierce the tough skin of the creature.
Nevertheless, he shot and his hand was
never steadier or his nerves cooler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>The elephant rose on his hind legs,
trumpeting with pain. Trim had put out
one of his eyes.</p>

<p>The lad then thought that he could
make for the raft, but in his fall he had
got to the edge of the river where there
was deep, thick mud.</p>

<p>He knew that he could not leap across
it, and if he attempted to walk across he
would get stuck there.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but that he
must run up the shore a few paces to a
point where the ground was harder at the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>This kept him directly in front of the
enraged elephant, but the risk had to be
taken.</p>

<p>He would have fired at the elephant’s
other eye if he could have had an opportunity
to aim at it. The great beast was
raging about and swinging his trunk so
that there was no getting a mark of any
kind that would be useful.</p>

<p>The elephant’s trunk happened to
crash against a tree that grew near the
bank. Instantly the elephant coiled his
trunk about the tree and with a mighty
wrench tore it roots and all from the
ground and hurled it aside.</p>

<p>This would have been Trim’s opportunity
if it had not been that the tree in
being thrown by the elephant brushed
against him and knocked him over.</p>

<p>Dobbin and the blacks upon the raft
were watching the scene in helpless terror.</p>

<p>The elephant then evidently got his
well eye on Trim, for he bounded forward
with his trunk upraised. He
brought it down just as Trim was struggling
to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to let you step on me,
you brute!” thought Trim, desperately,
as he threw both arms about the elephant’s
trunk.</p>

<p>The boy had not a very clear idea of
what he could do by this, but he felt that
it gave him his only chance to keep out
from under the giant animal’s feet.</p>

<p>The elephant bellowed and pranced
about wildly. He coiled his trunk
around Trim, who did not need to hang
on, for it held him fast and raised him
high up into the air.</p>

<p>The blacks on the raft fell upon their
knees and put their faces in their hands.</p>

<p>They were perfectly certain of what
would happen. The elephant intended
to dash Trim to the ground with such
force that every bone in his body would
be broken.</p>

<p>He held the boy poised in air for an
instant, just as a ball player sometimes
holds the ball in his hand at arm’s length
before he throws; then he swayed his
trunk backward and forward more and
more each time. Finally, with another
terrific roar he whirled the trunk back as
far as he could and then let it shoot forward.</p>

<p>Trim had kept his eyes open during all
this, and his mind was at work as rapidly
and clearly as ever. He, too, realized
what the insane beast wanted to do.</p>

<p>Just as the trunk began to shoot forward
he fired his revolver into the finger-like
end of the trunk.</p>

<p>The flesh there is soft and sensitive.</p>

<p>The elephant’s roar changed to a snort
of pain, the grip of the trunk was released,
and Trim, instead of being hurled
down to the ground, shot outward from
the swaying trunk, flew through the air
not less than forty feet and fell into the
river.</p>

<p>He prepared himself for the dive as he
went, and consequently struck the water
in such a way that the breath was not
knocked out of him.</p>

<p>He went under, but came up again almost
at once, as gracefully as if he had
dived from a plank into a mill pond.</p>

<p>“Push out from shore, you frightened
chumps!” he shouted, “and take me
aboard.”</p>

<p>The blacks on the raft, amazed at hearing
his voice behind them, when they
supposed that he was being dashed to
pieces upon the ground, jumped to their
poles and pushed out.</p>

<p>A moment later Trim climbed on board
and laid hold of the poles with them, for
he thought it still possible that the elephant
might pursue and as long as there
was shallow water the big beast might
make things hot for them.</p>

<p>The big beast evidently had enough of
it, however. He stood on the bank, raising
his huge feet up and down, swinging
his trunk, and trumpeting loudly.</p>

<p>The men on the rafts got into mid
stream, where the water was deep, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
then allowed the current to push them
on.</p>

<p>The last they saw of the elephant he
had waded into the river and crouched
down there apparently trying to ease his
wounded eye and trunk by holding them
under water.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br><br>
<small>THE BATTLE IN THE MEADOW.</small></h2>

<p>It was not long after the adventure
with the elephant when Trim took out
the pocket spyglass that he had risked his
life to save and looked through it at the
top of a distant hill on the northern side
of the river.</p>

<p>“Ee took big chances to get that play-thing,
lad,” remarked Dobbin, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Trim.</p>

<p>“If ee keep up that kind of fool play,”
continued the old sailor, “ye’ll never live
long enough to be hanged.”</p>

<p>Trim grunted again.</p>

<p>“Come, lad,” persisted Dobbin; “do
let an ole fellow like me give ee a bit of
advice. It’s all well enough to be brave
an’ do ee duty to the law an’ hunt down
criminals, but ee have got yer own life to
think of an’ ee shouldn’t forget that ee
have friends and relations, perhaps, who
think well of ee.</p>

<p>“It would be a sore day for ole Dobbin,
to mention the poorest of your friends,
if he should have to go back thinkin’ of
ee as stamped to death by an elephant or
murdered by these heathen savages.”</p>

<p>“Dobbin,” said Trim, suddenly, putting
down the glass; “you’re not the least
of my friends. You are one of the best I
ever had, and I have got relations, too,
that I haven’t seen for a long time.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you my word that I will try
to be careful in the future for your sake
and for theirs, and I’ll promise, too, that
after we get through with this case I
won’t be persuaded to do any more detective
work of any kind until I get back to
America.”</p>

<p>“It does me heart good to hear ee say
that, lad!” exclaimed Dobbin.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” continued Trim,
“I’m glad I went back after this spyglass.”</p>

<p>“Aye! I suppose ee thinks a good
deal of the little thing.”</p>

<p>“It’s almost as useful to me as my revolver.
Take it, Dobbin, and bring it to
bear on the top of that rocky hill off to
the north.”</p>

<p>Dobbin looked as directed, and after a
minute he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, well!”</p>

<p>“What do you see?” asked Trim.</p>

<p>“It’s a white man, lad.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, and he’s looking at us,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>Dobbin handed the glass back to Trim.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Trim, “just think
a minute. We are hundreds of miles
from the nearest white settlement. This
part of Africa is so little known that the
maps don’t pretend to give the courses of
rivers.</p>

<p>“Mighty few explorers have been here,
and the long and short of it is that that
white man off on the hill is one of the
men we want to meet!”</p>

<p>“Ee think he’s one of those that have
joined the Narugas, lad?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt of it. Let’s see
what the blacks have to say.”</p>

<p>Trim questioned his men and learned
from them that although the Narugas’
territory had not been reached, nevertheless
they were not many miles from it.</p>

<p>They told him that the place where
they expected to make a landing would
be reached by another day’s journey.</p>

<p>Further questions brought out the fact
that the second expedition of the police
against Mulvey and the Narugas had
landed at that spot.</p>

<p>“That settles it, then,” said Trim.
“We won’t land there.</p>

<p>“By this time Miller certainly has
reached them unless he has been prevented
from doing so by savage tribes. That
isn’t likely, for it looks as if the Massais,
at least, had helped him on.</p>

<p>“Now the white men who came to the
drunken camp undoubtedly learned that
a party of white travelers had been there.</p>

<p>“This fellow off on the hilltop may be
the same man. If not he’s at least one
of them who is on the lookout and who
is therefore aware of our approach.</p>

<p>“That being the case, the most natural
thing in the world for Mulvey and his
men would be to prepare an ambush at
the landing or near it where the second
police expedition went ashore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Trim believed that he and his party
were better armed than the Narugas
would be, and that therefore, if it came
to a battle the chances would be in his
favor.</p>

<p>Of course he did not wish to have
bloodshed, if it could be avoided. He
was especially anxious that none of his
own men should be injured as a result of
the undertaking.</p>

<p>He thought, therefore, that it would
be not only better to avoid a battle at the
landing, but that it would be a good plan
to go on shore and force a way through
the wilderness in the hope of coming on
the Narugas who might be in waiting at
the landing.</p>

<p>“The chances are,” so his thoughts
ran, “that Mulvey and his white companions
will be there, and if they prepare an
ambush for us it will be the best chance
in the world to bag the whole lot of them
by surprising the ambush.”</p>

<p>Trim determined to make a try for
this, and accordingly after the rafts had
drifted down stream until they were out
of sight of the hill, where he had seen
the white man watching him, ordered his
men to make a landing.</p>

<p>They had to go down stream several
miles further before they could find a
place where there seemed to be any possibility
of driving the donkeys through the
forest and over the hills.</p>

<p>Even at the place where they finally
landed the forest was so dense that it was
impossible to ride the donkeys through
it. The little beasts were therefore
loaded with the baggage of the expedition,
while the men walked beside them.</p>

<p>By referring to his map Trim found
that it was about here that the Orange
River made an immense curve in shape
somewhat like a horseshoe.</p>

<p>Trim’s party had landed at one toe of
this horseshoe, so to speak, and the spot
where his men had intended to land was
at the other toe.</p>

<p>To reach the other toe by river would
mean a journey of many miles, whereas
to go there in a straight line overland
would be but a few miles.</p>

<p>These few miles by land, however, lay
across steep and thickly-wooded mountains.
It would doubtless take longer to
go by land than it would by water.</p>

<p>This fact did not disappoint Trim at
all. On the other hand it seemed to him
to be very much in his favor, for he was
anxious to give the white criminals who
were the leaders of the Narugas time to
go down to the other landing and prepare
their ambush, if that should be their
plan.</p>

<p>On the theory that they would do this
Trim reasoned that they would wait there
for the party on the rafts to appear.</p>

<p>If the rafts did not appear they would
simply keep on waiting and so give Trim
time to cross the mountains and fall upon
them from the rear.</p>

<p>He was thinking over this plan while
the party was preparing to start into the
forest, and just before the start was made
he cut the cords that bound the rafts to
the bank and with one of the long poles
pushed them both out into the current.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s all right, lad,” Dobbin
remarked, “but seems to me it’s possible
we may want to use those rafts
again.”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” returned Trim.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued Dobbin, “we
may find we cannot force a way over these
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we can’t,” said Trim, “we
can make new rafts.</p>

<p>“Meantime, if those two float down the
river, as I hope they will, they may help
us.”</p>

<p>Dobbin was unable to see how this was
possible, and Trim was too busy just then
to explain.</p>

<p>The worst of their journey overland
was at the very beginning, for the undergrowth
in the forest was so dense that in
many places it was necessary to stop and
cut a path with hatchets.</p>

<p>This made progress extremely slow,
and when it came nightfall they were
not more than half way up the mountain
slope.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Trim his men were a
contented lot. They admired his courage
and determination, and were perfectly
willing to do anything that he wished.</p>

<p>It often happens to travelers in Central
Africa that their natives desert them. If
this had happened to Trim he would
have been indeed in a bad way, but his
employees were faithful.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Trim climbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
a tall tree and made an examination of
the surrounding country.</p>

<p>His experience in the wild districts of
America proved of use to him now, for
his trained eyes discovered signs of a pass
between the mountains that was certain
to be easier than the course they were
taking over them.</p>

<p>Accordingly he led the party through
the forest along the side of the mountain
until they came to a gully that seemed to
extend far inland.</p>

<p>It was the bed of what had once been a
stream. A little brook was even now
trickling through it to the river, but for
the most part the gully was dry.</p>

<p>The sure-footed donkeys had no difficulty
whatever in climbing along this
natural path, and the result was that for
several miles the party made comparatively
rapid progress.</p>

<p>As they went further up the gully became
smaller, and at last they had to
force their way again through a section
of forest.</p>

<p>The undergrowth here was not as thick
as it was at the river bank, and it was
not long before they crossed the highest
point of the ledge and began to descend.</p>

<p>Shortly after that they came as Trim
had hoped they would to another stream.</p>

<p>This time the bed of the stream was
not dry but it nevertheless allowed of a
much easier passage down the mountain
than could have been found by going directly
through the forest.</p>

<p>They followed along this stream sometimes
upon its banks, sometimes wading
in it, until they came to the top of a
waterfall.</p>

<p>There Trim called to the party to halt
until he should be able to find a way
down the ledge.</p>

<p>There was a descent of about fifty feet
and the spray that came up from below
hung like a cloud over the edge of the
precipice.</p>

<p>Glad of a chance to rest, the men threw
themselves upon the ground while Trim
wandered along the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>He had no sooner got beyond the cloud
of spray than he stopped abruptly and
took out his spyglass. The spray rising
from the waterfall had concealed the
country lying around completely.</p>

<p>From where he now stood he could see
the Orange River less than a mile away.
It took little reflection to show him that
the river at this point reached the other
toe of the horseshoe to which he was
going.</p>

<p>He could see that from the base of the
cliff the mountain sloped gently to the
river bank, and he could also see a spot
where undoubtedly the former police expedition
had landed.</p>

<p>It was a meadow on which not a single
tree grew. This meadow was not broad
but it extended inland for something like
half a mile.</p>

<p>What aroused Trim’s interest most,
however, was not the meadow which
afforded such a convenient place for landing
but two specks floating down the
river.</p>

<p>A glance through his glass showed him
that they were the rafts upon which he
and his party had been sailing.</p>

<p>“Now,” he thought, “if that doesn’t
bring the enemy from under cover I
shan’t know where to find them.”</p>

<p>He turned his glass to the edges of the
meadow, moving it slowly so as to inspect
its entire length from the river bank to
where it ended in the forest again.</p>

<p>He had not long to look before he saw
something that satisfied him greatly.
Several men were coming out from the
edge of the forest and crossing the meadow
toward the river.</p>

<p>Trim could see that their attention had
been taken by the empty rafts. There
was no doubt that they had been in hiding
at the meadow’s edge waiting for the
white travelers to land from their rafts
at that convenient point.</p>

<p>Seeing the rafts floating down empty
they had come from under their cover as
Trim had hoped that they would, and
were approaching the river doubtless
wondering what had become of the travelers.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ll think that we were
slaughtered by that drunken tribe,”
thought Trim, but he immediately reflected
that this could not be, for by this
time the Narugas and their white leaders
could have been informed as to the
escape of the travelers at that point.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” thought Trim, as he
looked at the men through his glass,
“there are three whites in that gang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
down there which proves that I was not
much mistaken in my theory as to what
they would do.</p>

<p>“There aren’t more than a dozen
blacks with them. It’s too good a chance
to lose. I must get our net out and
make an effort to snare that entire
party.”</p>

<p>Trim hurried along the edge of the
cliff until he found a place where the
donkeys could descend. Then he went
back to the edge of the falls and told his
men what he had seen and what he
wished to do.</p>

<p>They were perfectly willing and ready
to make the attempt with him. Working
as rapidly as possible they got the
donkeys and all the baggage of the expedition
down to the bottom of the cliff,
where they found it necessary to proceed
along its base toward the waterfall because
the ground was too steep and the
forest too thick to proceed further just
there.</p>

<p>Trim had seen that from the bottom
of the falls the ground sloped gently.</p>

<p>“We don’t want the donkeys with us,”
he said to the men, “and we might as
well leave them here.”</p>

<p>There was a great hollow in the cliff
back of the falls.</p>

<p>This is often the case in waterfalls,
and Trim was not surprised to find that
he could make his way in there without
difficulty.</p>

<p>It took some coaxing to get the donkeys
to go in, for they were apparently
frightened at the roar of the falling water.
Once inside, however, they were quiet
enough and Trim left them tied to the
rough edges of rocks so that they might
not slip away and fall into the stream.</p>

<p>It was really a good hiding place, for
back of the donkeys and the baggage
which was also taken in there was a
mountain ledge.</p>

<p>In front was the sheet of falling water,
and the only way in was at the sides by
a passage that only one or two men could
enter at a time, and which could not be
seen from outside without hunting for it.</p>

<p>It did not take long to get the donkeys
and the baggage in place. Then Trim
and his men went out into the open air
again and started down toward the
meadow.</p>

<p>They went cautiously, for there was
no telling but that the white men and
their black companions might be hid
somewhere in their course.</p>

<p>Trim and his party arrived at the edge
of the meadow without meeting anybody.</p>

<p>Pausing there and looking toward the
river they saw that the party whom Trim
had seen from the top of the cliff were on
the bank of the river.</p>

<p>They had managed somehow to catch
one of the rafts and had dragged it to the
shore.</p>

<p>“No doubt they’re wondering,” said
Trim to Dobbin, “what has become of
the men who were traveling on it.</p>

<p>“Now, men, we must keep in the edge
of the woods and get down as close to the
river as we can before they realize what
we are up to. Then we’ll see if we can
stampede them.</p>

<p>“If we succeed, as we probably shall,
drive off the blacks and capture the white
men.”</p>

<p>Trim’s men understood so well what
his object was that they did not need
more definite instructions. They were
all excited and anxious for success.</p>

<p>They kept just far enough from the
edge of the forest to be concealed by the
trees and yet not so far that they could
not look out upon the meadow and see
what the enemy were doing.</p>

<p>Trim grew more and more hopeful as
they advanced, but he had not yet come
to the point that he wanted to reach before
making his attack when he saw that
the enemy were turning about and
starting up the meadow on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>The boy was badly disappointed.</p>

<p>“They’re half facing us now,” he
thought, “and so we can’t catch them
so much by surprise. Maybe, too, they
are already suspicious of what has happened,
though I don’t much think they’re
as shrewd as all that.</p>

<p>“At all events, it is no use of our trying
to keep concealed any longer, for with
every step they take they get further
away from us.”</p>

<p>“Now, men,” he said aloud; “we must
make a charge. Remember, I want you to
scatter the blacks, but not slaughter
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t shoot to kill unless I say the
word!”</p>

<p>There was just an instant’s pause for
every man to get ready for the charge,
then Trim gave the command in ringing
tones and the entire party pushed from
under cover of the forest and made for
the blacks and their white leaders.</p>

<p>There was no question about the surprise
with which the attack was received.
The entire body of the enemy stood still.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” shouted Trim at the
top of his voice, while he aimed his revolver
at one of the whites.</p>

<p>The blacks in the enemy’s party immediately
took to their heels and made for
the other side of the meadow.</p>

<p>At the same instant one of the white
men in Trim’s party lost his head
through the excitement of the affair and
fired at the retreating blacks.</p>

<p>He stood almost beside Trim at the
moment and the smoke from his rifle
shut out the view for the fraction of a
second.</p>

<p>That brief time completely changed the
whole affair. It might have gone just as
Trim had planned it, although it is possible,
too, that the three whites might
have made a stubborn fight. However,
what happened was this:</p>

<p>Trim called to his man angrily not to
fire until he was ordered to do so, and
jumped aside in order to get out of the
smoke where he could see clearly.</p>

<p>He jumped just in time to escape a bullet
that was sent by one of the white enemies
for that spot.</p>

<p>The bullet missed Trim and struck the
faithful Dobbin in the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ah, lad, I’m hit!” cried Dobbin, as
he stumbled and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Trim’s heart sank like lead. It seemed
to him at that instant as if the capture of
all the criminals in the world was not
worth the life of his faithful old friend.</p>

<p>He turned from the enemy and bent
hastily over Dobbin.</p>

<p>“It’s not a fatal wound, old fellow!”
he cried. “Keep your courage up! I
shall take care of you whatever happens.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me, lad, fight it out!”
groaned Dobbin.</p>

<p>“Fire, men!” cried Trim, now thoroughly
aroused to make a fight in behalf
of his wounded companion.</p>

<p>The men needed no second bidding, but
before they had fired a shot the three
whites had turned about and ran for the
cover of the forest.</p>

<p>Trim’s men shot wildly. None of the
whites were hit, and the little battle
ended therefore with a complete upsetting
of Trim’s plans and with the only damage
inflicted upon his side.</p>

<p>“It’s another case of retreat,” he said
to himself. “If I don’t get Dobbin out
of this the poor old fellow will be done for.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get under cover ourselves
and get out of this.”</p>

<p>He called one of the whites to him and
between them they got Dobbin under the
shelter of one of the trees. The old sailor
groaned with pain, and Trim saw that
his wound needed a good deal of attention.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for this,” he said, “I’d
make a break for those fellows on the
other side of the meadow and we’d settle
this thing here and now. But I’ve got to
take care of Dobbin first.</p>

<p>“We must go back to the hiding-place
under the falls; then we’ll see what the
rest of us can do.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br><br>
<small>HOLDING THE FORT.</small></h2>

<p>Dobbin was carried by the two white
men in the party up the mountain slope
to the base of the falls. Trim and the
blacks marched in the rear in order to
resist any attack that might be made upon
them by the Narugas.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” thought Trim, “that
Mulvey and his men won’t stop now until
they have made an effort at least to
slaughter us or drive us out of the country.</p>

<p>“Miller is undoubtedly with them, and
has told them what he knows or thinks
he knows of me. They will understand,
therefore, that I’m not regularly connected
with the British police, and that
in fighting me they are not necessarily
fighting against the English Government.</p>

<p>“For that reason they won’t have so
much hesitation about shooting us down.</p>

<p>“When the chief of the Kimberley
police was here leading an expedition
against them, the Narugas, under their
white leader, took great pains not to kill
their enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“That was because they did not want
to excite the English authorities into
sending a powerful army into this country;
so at that time they pursued a policy of
retreat and hiding.</p>

<p>“It’s almost certain to be different with
me. They think that they have defeated
us in this little skirmish on the meadow
and there’s no denying that they’re right.</p>

<p>“That will lead them to follow up their
advantage by making an attack on us
while we are supposed to be frightened
and disabled.</p>

<p>“Well, let them come on. As long as
I can get Dobbin into a place of safety I
don’t care much what happens.”</p>

<p>Progress up the mountain was slow because
the men had to go carefully in order
to save Dobbin from injury.</p>

<p>His wound was a painful one, and in
spite of his pluck, he showed that he
was suffering intensely.</p>

<p>There were frequent halts for rest,
therefore, and Trim began to fear that
the Narugas might come up and detect
them before they had reached the falls.</p>

<p>This did not happen, however, but just
as the party came close to the base of the
falls he looked back and caught a glimpse
of a part of the meadow.</p>

<p>He then saw that a very large body of
blacks was crossing it.</p>

<p>The blacks were going slowly and
were scattered over a considerable portion
of the meadow.</p>

<p>“That shows,” said Trim to himself,
“that they are directed by intelligent
white men.</p>

<p>“They think that we are hiding in the
forest at the edge of the meadow, they
don’t exactly know where; therefore they
scatter their men so that if we opened fire
on them we should not be able to do as
much damage as if the men went forward
in a bunch.</p>

<p>“That’s the white man’s style of warfare.
They won’t find us down there,
and they’ll probably come further up the
mountain.</p>

<p>“There must be three or four hundred
of them. I don’t believe that many of
the blacks have firearms. Even if they
have, I reckon that we fellows will be able
to give them a hot afternoon’s work.”</p>

<p>Trim said nothing to his companions
about the advancing party of Narugas
until Dobbin had been taken under the
falls and made comfortable upon a dry
shelving rock there.</p>

<p>Then Trim explained the situation to
the two white men, and told them what
he thought was the best plan for meeting
the attack.</p>

<p>There were weapons enough in the
party to give each man either a revolver
or a rifle.</p>

<p>Not more than three men at the very
most could stand together at either of the
entrances to the cave beneath the falls.</p>

<p>Trim stationed a white man and two
blacks at each of these entrances.</p>

<p>“Now then,” he said, “I’m going to
attend to Dobbin’s wound. The enemy
can’t possibly get at us through the falls.
The only way that they can get in here is
by coming in the same way that we did.</p>

<p>“Three men at each entrance is as good
as a thousand.</p>

<p>“When they come up, if they attack,
fire at them until you have emptied every
cartridge, then stand back and let three
other men take your places.</p>

<p>“Those who have fired will reload at
once, ready to jump in again as soon as
the second three have fired.</p>

<p>“In this way,” Trim concluded, “we
can keep up a battle as long as we have
got a cartridge left, and I should be surprised
if our ammunition doesn’t hold out
as long as theirs does.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got a big advantage in shooting
from under cover,” remarked one of the
whites.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Trim, “but they
outnumber us a good many times. If the
savages are as desperate as savages sometimes
are, they may force an entrance in
spite of anything.”</p>

<p>“Let them try it!” muttered the white
man, looking carefully at his rifle.</p>

<p>The blacks in the party were silent, but
Trim knew that they could be depended
on.</p>

<p>They were not experienced fighters, but
they were in a situation where it was perfectly
certain that they had got to fight
for their lives, and he therefore had faith
that they would stand to their guns manfully.
Having arranged his men for the attack,
Trim gave all his own attention to
Dobbin.</p>

<p>From his earliest boyhood Trim had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
had experience in the western parts of
America in caring for men who were injured,
either by accident or as a result of
shooting affairs.</p>

<p>He knew therefore just what to do for
Dobbin, and he had been wise enough to
include in the baggage taken by the party
a quantity of bandages, salves, and other
matters that were necessary for the proper
dressing of wounds.</p>

<p>It appeared that the ball had entered
Dobbin’s shoulder, struck a bone, turned
upward, and passed out.</p>

<p>This made a long, irregular wound
which was very painful, but which, as
Trim soon saw, was not dangerous, provided
it were treated right.</p>

<p>It gave him a great relief to discover
that the ball had gone out.</p>

<p>“If I had to pick lead out of you, Dobbin,”
he said, cheerfully, “there wouldn’t
be so much fun in it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps ee calls it fun to lie here
with a broken shoulder, lad?” returned
Dobbin.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I know it isn’t fun, but
you’re not going to die, and more than
that, your shoulder isn’t broken.”</p>

<p>“Not broken, hey? Then why can’t I
move my right arm, and what makes that
horrible ache along the bone there?”</p>

<p>“The bullet has plowed all along the
bone, and of course that hurts, but I’m
sure nothing is broken, and if you’ll be
patient, I’ll have you fixed up in a few
minutes so that you’ll be more comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got all the patience there is,
lad. I only wish that I could be up and
take a hand in the fight!”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be room for you,” responded
Trim.</p>

<p>Meantime he was busy cutting away
Dobbin’s clothing, and applying bandages
and cleansing the wound.</p>

<p>“Ye work like a regular saw-bones,
lad,” muttered Dobbin, after a time.</p>

<p>“I’ve done this sort of thing before,”
he responded.</p>

<p>With all his skill and speed it took
Trim a good many minutes to get the
shoulder so bandaged that Dobbin could
be left alone.</p>

<p>The task was not quite completed when
one of the blacks came to him and said:</p>

<p>“The Narugas are coming up the
mountain, and we have just seen them
through the trees a little way below.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ll think that we’re in
here?” Trim reflected.</p>

<p>Aloud he said:</p>

<p>“Tell the men at each entrance not to
fire until attacked. Let the enemy go by
if they will.”</p>

<p>It proved that the attacking party had
not suspected the hiding-place of Trim
and his companions.</p>

<p>They had never noticed the entrance to
the big cavern under the falls. As they
went further up the mountainside they
were more and more puzzled to think
what had become of their foes.</p>

<p>The white man who guarded the entrance
through which the donkeys had
been driven saw a dozen or more blacks
pass within a hundred feet of him and
examine the ground.</p>

<p>It was evident that they saw the tracks
of the donkeys. It was just as clear that
they were puzzled because the tracks all
pointed in one direction.</p>

<p>They stopped a moment and consulted,
and then began to follow the tracks
along, gradually approaching the falls.</p>

<p>Trim, still busy with Dobbin’s needs,
did not know what was happening until
he heard the report of firearms at one of
the entrances.</p>

<p>The white man in charge there had
waited until the savages were less than
fifty feet away. It seemed to him that the
very next instant they would discover
the hiding-place and make an attack.</p>

<p>He believed it to be right and wise to
get in the first blow; accordingly, he
told the blacks who were keeping watch
with him to fire.</p>

<p>One of the blacks had a shotgun, the
other a revolver, the white had a fine rifle.</p>

<p>The three weapons went off together,
and evidently each shot took effect, for
three of the attacking party staggered
back and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The others stood stock still in amazement
for just a second and then began to
dash down the slope.</p>

<p>“Ye’re needed where the fight is, lad,”
said Dobbin. “Go and help the fellows
an’ don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Trim, “you can rest
for a few minutes anyway. I’ll go and
see what’s up and come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>He hurried to the entrance to the cave
and found the three guards exulting over
their easy victory. “I’ll bet,” exclaimed
the white, “that they were surprised
when they saw shots coming from the
waterfall. I don’t believe they saw us at
all, and probably they can’t tell exactly
where we are.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if they think that
the waterfall is enchanted.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they do!” responded Trim;
“but the white leaders will know better.
The fight is only just begun.”</p>

<p>Even at that moment they heard a
voice somewhere down among the trees
shouting angrily.</p>

<p>The words could not be understood, for
they were spoken in the Naruga language,
but Trim was certain that the
voice was that of a white man.</p>

<p>It proved that he was not mistaken
when a moment later a large number of
savages were seen approaching up the hill
toward the falls and among them he distinguished
one of the whites whom he
had seen on the meadow.</p>

<p>It looked as if the blacks were alarmed
and were advancing unwillingly.</p>

<p>The white kept up his shouting, from
which it was easy to guess that he was determined
that Trim and all of his companions
should be slaughtered. “Give
me room there,” he said, quietly, to one
of the guards.</p>

<p>The guard stepped back and Trim took
his place at the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>The mist rising from the waterfall
floated before him, and it was often so
dense that he could not see through it.</p>

<p>He waited until the light breeze that
was blowing cleared away the cloud of
spray for a moment, and then drew upon
the white leader of the Narugas.</p>

<p>At that moment the leader was standing
perhaps two hundred feet away looking
in the direction of the falls. He was trying
to locate the enemy.</p>

<p>“This is where we are, boss!” shouted
Trim, as he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The leader apparently caught sight of
Trim just as the revolver spoke, for he
leaped aside and made for a tree.</p>

<p>He was too late. The pistol ball sped
faster than he could, and it struck him as
Trim had intended, in the right arm.</p>

<p>“He won’t shoot again to-day,”
thought Trim, “unless he’s left-handed.”</p>

<p>The shot caused a panic among the savages
who had been driven on to the attack
by their leader. Trim could see
them turning about and getting down hill
as fast as they could on their hands and
knees. Not one of them ventured to rise.</p>

<p>Trim’s companions wanted to fire after
them, but the boy forbade them.</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in killing them unnecessarily,”
he said; “let them scoot if
they want to. A scare is just as good for
them as a beating.”</p>

<p>At that moment there was a sound of
firing at the other entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>Leaving his guards with orders to fight
off any further attack that might be made,
Trim hurried around under the falls, passing
Dobbin and the donkeys, until he
came to the other entrance.</p>

<p>That was even narrower than the first,
and much more difficult of use.</p>

<p>The water came down so close to the
side of the ledge there that the guards
stationed at that point were wet to the
skin by the splashing of drops and spray.</p>

<p>Much the same thing had happened
there as at the first entrance. A party of
savages had come up on that side of the
stream and the guards had opened fire on
them. The result was that the blacks
retreated. Trim heard there also the tones
of a voice shouting angry commands. He
tried in vain to get a glimpse of the man,
and presently became aware from the direction
from which the voice came that
the speaker was making his way across
the stream to the other side of the falls.</p>

<p>As there were no savages in sight, Trim
returned to the first entrance and again
took the place of one of the guards there.</p>

<p>He could see that the man whom he
had shot had struggled to his feet and
was now leaning against a tree in such a
way that the greater part of his body was
protected.</p>

<p>Presently he recognized the voice that
he had heard issuing commands upon the
other side of the falls, and then he saw a
white man striding toward the wounded
man with a rifle in his hands.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” cried the
new-comer, in plain English. “You cowardly
sneak! why didn’t you lead your
men up to the falls as I told you to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“They went back on me,” was the reply,
“and I won’t be called a sneak,
either!”</p>

<p>It was difficult to see exactly what happened
because the men were so far down
among the trees, but there was the sound
of two shots fired almost together. After
that all was still.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” thought Trim, “if these
two have had a long standing quarrel and
have now shot each other? I shall have
to find out about it.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br><br>
<small>KING MULVEY’S BRIDGE.</small></h2>

<p>He returned to Dobbin, finished what
was necessary to do in caring for the sailor’s
wound, and then took a look at the
guards at each entrance.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be in as good
condition as could be asked, for the men
were as determined as ever to repel any
and all attacks upon them.</p>

<p>Not a sound had been heard from the
savages outside.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make an exploration,”
said Trim to the white man on guard at
the first entrance, “and I may not get
back until after dark.</p>

<p>“When I do I’ll give you a signal so
that you may be sure not to fire at me.</p>

<p>“Your best plan will be to call any one
to a halt who approaches, and if he
doesn’t say Kimberley, shoot him down;
if he says Kimberley, you can know that
it is me.”</p>

<p>The guards told him that they understood,
and Trim accordingly left the cavern.
He went down the slope to the
spot where he had heard the two shots.</p>

<p>There he found the bodies of two
whites. One was dead, and the other, the
man whom he had wounded was dying
from a second wound inflicted by his companion.</p>

<p>“Give me something to drink,” this
man groaned as he saw Trim.</p>

<p>Trim placed a flask of liquor to the
man’s lips immediately. It revived him
to a considerable extent, but Trim could
see that he had not long to live.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re the plucky American
detective?” this man muttered. “I’m
glad to set eyes on you before I die.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about me?” asked
Trim.</p>

<p>“I know all that Jem Miller could
tell,” was the faint reply. “He came out
to join us, and told such tremendous
stories of what you could do that all the
blacks were scared half to death.</p>

<p>“They were still more frightened when
shortly after Miller came a couple of fellows
that belonged to the Massais tribe
arrived with still more stories.</p>

<p>“I confess I was rather frightened myself
and I advised Mulvey and the others
to light out for the west coast and let you
waste your time hunting for us among
the mountains.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t have it so. They got
the idea that I was treacherous, and that’s
why Starkey shot me.”</p>

<p>“Is Starkey the dead man there?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I knew he would lay for me,
and I tried to get the drop on him first.
Well, I’ve got to go. I know that well
enough, and I can tell you, young fellow,
that you’ve still got a big job ahead of
you if you imagine that you are going to
break up Mulvey’s rule here or get your
man Miller.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see Mulvey now.”</p>

<p>“You are, hey? Where do you think
you’ll find him?”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll tell me just where to
go.”</p>

<p>The dying man looked at Trim with a
curious smile.</p>

<p>“Well now,” he muttered at length,
“if I could only live to see the fun. I
can’t do that, but I won’t spoil it.</p>

<p>“Go down to the end of the meadow
and you’ll find a trail leading up the
mountain at the other side. Follow that
trail straight up the rocks and you’ll come
to Mulvey’s palace.</p>

<p>“Miller will be there, and so will the
others by the time you get there. You’ll
have a good time.”</p>

<p>The dying man muttered a few words
that Trim could not distinguish, his
strength failed rapidly and a moment later
his heart stopped beating.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt,” thought Trim, as
he went on down the mountain, “that
that chap gave me the right steer; at the
same time he probably means that I shall
step right into the lion’s den, so to speak,
and a good time I’m likely to have to be
sure in keeping the beasts off.”</p>

<p>He kept eyes and ears open as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
went down the mountain for any sign or
sound of the enemy.</p>

<p>When he came to the edge of the
meadow he looked out toward the river
and saw a number of blacks hurrying
toward the bank where apparently they
were boarding a raft.</p>

<p>“It looks as if the blacks were being
scared out of the country,” thought
Trim. “That is not surprising when one
thinks that fears have been so stirred up
by the stories of Miller and the Massais
and by the shots that came at them from
the waterfall.”</p>

<p>Believing that he had nothing to fear
from the blacks now, he went directly
across the meadow without attempting to
conceal himself, and at the end found
just such a trail as the dying criminal had
told him about.</p>

<p>It led up a very steep mountain, and at
times he had to cling to roots and bushes
in order to get along; sometimes it led
along the very face of a precipice, and at
others he had to pull himself up by gripping
the edge of the rock above his head.</p>

<p>It was a strange path, but he was sure
that he was making no mistake, for he
could see many marks to show that others
had taken exactly the same course.</p>

<p>There were scratches evidently made
by the nails in men’s boots, and many a
bush and root was rubbed almost bare
where it had been grasped by many hands.</p>

<p>He came at length to the edge of a
precipice that dropped sheer down at least
three hundred feet.</p>

<p>He could not tell for a moment which
way the path ran here, but he followed
along the edge of the precipice in the
same general direction in which he had
been traveling until he came to a point
where less than fifty feet away was
another steep wall of rock.</p>

<p>Between him and the second wall was
a deep chasm. It reminded him of the
canyons with which he had become familiar
in Western America.</p>

<p>He recalled also the small canyon that
he had managed to cross during one of his
adventures in Australia, but in this place
there were no trees large enough to enable
him to climb them and bend the tops
down until he could drop down on the
other side.</p>

<p>“I’m not so certain, anyway,” he said
to himself, “that I want to get across.
Yes, I am, though, and I see the way.”</p>

<p>A little further away he saw that there
was a rope stretched directly from one
side of the chasm to the other.</p>

<p>He now proceeded very cautiously for
the presence of that rope there showed
him that he was on the track of white
men. He listened constantly for any
sound of human beings, but heard none.</p>

<p>At last he came to the spot where the
rope was fastened at his side of the chasm.
It was made fast upon a tree trunk which
grew at the very edge, and five or six feet
below it there was a little shelf of rock
just big enough for a man to stand on.</p>

<p>The rope went straight across to the
other side of the chasm, where it was
fastened above a broader shelf of rock.
The shelving at this side would have
held three or four men comfortably.</p>

<p>“This is their bridge,” thought Trim.
“I wonder if they get across by a hand-over-hand
act. If they do they are all
good athletes.”</p>

<p>He saw that there was a small cord lying
along the side of the rope across the
chasm. He pulled this cord and found
that it yielded.</p>

<p>He kept on pulling until he had drawn
across to this side a pulley block that
rolled upon the larger rope.</p>

<p>There was a hook attached to this, and
Trim saw that by catching to this hook
he could swing himself out over the chasm
and be carried then by his own weight so
far toward the other side that he could at
least get his feet upon the shelf of rock
there.</p>

<p>“This pulley block may be for freight
purposes only,” he thought, “but I’ll
make a passenger car out of it this time.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Trim that if he should
take hold of the hook with his hands, he
might be at disadvantage if anything
should happen that would make it necessary
for him to use his hands. He
thought of making a sling out of two or
three handkerchiefs, which he could slip
under his shoulders and tie to the hook,
but he feared that handkerchiefs would
not be strong enough to sustain his
weight.</p>

<p>While he was thinking of this matter
he saw another cord lying at the edge of
a rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>He went to this and found that it had
been left there evidently for just the purpose
that he needed.</p>

<p>At the end of it was a long piece of
stout cloth that could be used for a sling,
and from the marks upon it, it was apparent
that this was what it had been
used for.</p>

<p>The ends of the cloth were tied to an
iron ring. It seemed clear that the members
of Mulvey’s gang in crossing the
chasm were in the habit of fastening this
sling under their arms, hitching the ring
to the pulley hook and so sliding across
the rope.</p>

<p>The rope tied to the sling was undoubtedly
for throwing or drawing the
sling from one side of the chasm to the
other; so Trim put the sling under his
arms, hung the ring upon the hook and
jumped with all his force out over the
chasm.</p>

<p>The wheel in the pulley block worked
easily along the rope, and he slid therefore
rapidly toward the other side.</p>

<p>He was just about half way across the
chasm when two white men suddenly appeared
around the corner of the ledge on
the opposite side and jumped down to the
shelf where he intended to land.</p>

<p>They were armed with knives, and
were as desperate looking characters as it
had ever been his misfortune to meet.</p>

<p>They watched him coming with savage
grins. There was no turning back for
Trim; once started on that peculiar kind
of journey, he was obliged to go as far as
the pulley block would take him.</p>

<p>He uttered a loud scream and began to
kick his legs about as if he were trying
to stop the pulley. The men on the shelf
roared with laughter.</p>

<p>They believed that Trim was frightened
out of his senses. This was exactly what
he wanted them to believe, and it was for
that reason that he screamed and kept on
screaming while the sliding block brought
him nearer and nearer to the shelf.</p>

<p>It all took but a few seconds, and before
the white savages had ceased to shake
with laughter as they were thinking how
their plucky enemy was overcome with
fear, Trim was at the edge.</p>

<p>They reached out to grasp him, each
extending one arm and holding the other
back to strike with a knife.</p>

<p>Trim suddenly pulled himself up until
his chin was level with the pulley block,
at the same time doubling up his knees so
that they touched his chin.</p>

<p>Instantly his body straightened as he
threw his feet forward with all the force
that he could command. The white men,
still laughing and confident of success,
were taken completely by surprise.</p>

<p>Trim’s left foot caught one of the men
upon the neck and the other squarely
upon the forehead.</p>

<p>Both staggered back, and the one who
was struck in the neck lost his balance
and tumbled with a loud howl of terror
into the chasm. The other dropped his
knife and clutched blindly at Trim’s leg
to prevent himself from falling.</p>

<p>This clutch caused Trim to slide still
further along the rope so that in a half
second he was directly over the shelf. He
did not let go of the pulley block yet.</p>

<p>Before he ventured to do that he gave
the white man another vigorous kick.
The fellow, already half stunned, let go
his leg and rolled over the edge to join
his companion three hundred feet below.</p>

<p>Then Trim dropped to the shelf with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I reckon there’ll be no more trouble
from them,” he said to himself, “and
that accounts for four of these six men
that I came to find. Now for the
others.”</p>

<p>He listened a moment, and was certain
that he heard approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>“I must have the rest of these fellows
alive,” he thought, “or nobody will believe
that I have met them.”</p>

<p>With this he hastily drew his knife and
cut the small cord that was used for pulling
the pulley block from one side of the
chasm to the other.</p>

<p>In a moment this cord was dangling
from his hands down the side of the
chasm. Rapidly he coiled it up and held
it as he would a lariat.</p>

<p>The sound of the footsteps had ceased.
Trim cautiously made his way around the
corner of the ledge from where he had
seen his two enemies appear.</p>

<p>A few strides brought him to level
ground beyond the edge of the chasm.
He thought he saw a figure dodging
among the trees at a little distance. He
lay flat on the ground and waited. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
he saw a white man drawing carefully
near the edge of the chasm.</p>

<p>“This must be King Mulvey,”
thought Trim, “and it looks as if he had
heard my shrieks and the howls of one of
those fellows and had come out to see
what was going on.”</p>

<p>This was indeed the case. Mulvey,
who was dressed more like a savage than
a white man, and who carried a fine cord
in one hand, crept to the edge of the
rock and looked over. From that point
he could see down to the shelf where
Trim had had his struggle.</p>

<p>Nobody was in sight. Mulvey drew
himself up and looked around in evident
surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>“That cord,” thought Trim, “is undoubtedly
the one with which he committed
his murders. He did the Chinese
bowstring act with it, and he has done it
for the last time, although he’s got it now
with the hope of twisting it around my
neck.”</p>

<p>Mulvey once more looked over as if he
still hoped to see some sign of his men
below.</p>

<p>Trim arose and advanced carefully
toward him. Mulvey heard him, and
started up suddenly.</p>

<p>This was what Trim wanted, for it
gave him a good mark for his throw.
There was a whir of flying rope, and the
next instant Mulvey’s neck was in a
noose.</p>

<p>Trim drew the cord so tight that the
man could hardly breathe. Then he went
up to him, and at the point of a revolver
compelled him to lead the way to his
castle.</p>

<p>This castle proved to be little more
than a hut, but in it was the steeple-jack,
Jemmy Miller, too frightened to make any
resistance.</p>

<p>Both men were at Trim’s mercy, Mulvey
because by a single jerk of the cord
Trim could have choked him to death,
Miller because he knew that Trim was
ready to fire at any sign of flight.</p>

<p>It took them many long hours to return
to the waterfall by a roundabout route,
for Trim would not attempt to take his
prisoners down the steep path by which
he had climbed up.</p>

<p>They arrived at last, however, and on
the next day began to journey back to
Kimberley. They met with no adventures
of importance on the way back, and
it is sufficient to say that Trim was received
with great enthusiasm by the officials
of that city.</p>

<p>He left Mulvey and Miller there to be
dealt with according to the law, and,
faithful to his promise to Dobbin, set out
for America, where he found plenty of
detective work to do.</p>

<p>His first experience upon his return
home is told in “Trim Changes Cars; or,
Taking Big Chances for a Quick Capture,”
in No. 12 of the <span class="smcap">New Nick Carter
Weekly</span>.</p>
